"1-Minute Mindfulness","Lifestyle","GeekGirl Marketing and App Development","1-Minute Mindfulness from Walking Affirmations is a skill that allows you to take a break from the world around you and enter into a one minute sound meditation. Practicing mindfulness improves both mental and physical health. Mindfulness involves both concentration (a form of meditation) and acceptance. Many people struggle with how to begin meditating and get the rewards of a more contemplative life, so this skill is the perfect way to start a meditation practice. You can change your life, and change the world... one minute at a time. \n\nAs your meditation begins, remember all you have to do is focus on your breath. However this is harder than it seems. As your mind begins to wander, notice it, accept it lovingly and return your focus to your breathing. Its a little like training a puppy. As your mind thinks of other things, lovingly and gently return the focus to your breath. In time you will be able to stay present and focused for the full length of time. \n\nThere are several different meditations available. You can ask for a peaceful meditation or one with specific sounds. You can ask for a quick meditation or a forest meditation. You can also ask for a river meditation. Each of these one minute meditations will play a related meditative soundtrack to help you tune out the world and focus on your breath.\n\nHere are some examples of what you can say:\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a quick meditation""\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a 1 minute meditation""\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a minute meditation""\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a peaceful meditation""\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a river meditation""\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a forest meditation""\n\nYou can also use the example phrases below as your guide.

We talked about putting a pen and paper by the changing station, but realized that it would be really easy if there was a Alexa skill that could do this. This skill is designed to do just what it says. Track stats for your baby, and be able to repeat them back to you. \n\nJust say:\nAlexa, ask baby stats to add stool\nAlexa, ask baby stats to add wet,\nAlexa, ask baby stats to add meal.\nAlexa, ask baby stats when was the last poop\nAlexa, ask baby stats when was the last pee\nAlexa, ask baby stats what time was the last feeding\n\nWe've added as many words as we could think of to signify ""stool"" or ""wet"". Other examples are poop, pee etc... Try to see if you can find the extra easter egg ones :). Baby stats will count the stats against the current day. Once midnight rolls around everything will be tracked against the next day etc and onward.\n\nYou can also ask Alexa to remove or delete stool, wet or meal as well.\n\nExample:\nAlexa, ask baby stats to remove meal.\n\nAs you tally up the stats each day you can go back and ask Alexa to ""get"" those stats and repeat them back to you.\nAlexa, ask baby stats when was the last poop\nAlexa, ask baby stats when was the last pee\nAlexa, ask baby stats what time was the last feeding\nAlexa, ask baby stats to get stats for February 27\nAlexa, ask baby stats to get stats for last Monday.\nAlexa, ask baby stats to get stats for this week\n\nLastly, don't forget to say ""Alexa, ask baby stats to set timezone"" {pacific, eastern, or central} so that it counts the whole day. It currently defaults to pacific time, so otherwise it may switch over to a new day 3 hours late.\n\nIf you want to view everything that you've tracked:\n1. Alexa, ask baby stats to get id. This will tell you your unique ID that is used to store the data.\n2. Navigate to http://babystatsapi.azurewebsites.net/viewer.html in any browser and enter the ID and click ""Load"" \n\nHappy baby tracking!\n\nFull list of examples to say to baby stats:\nAlexa, ask baby stats to add stool\nAlexa ask baby stats to add poo\nAlexa, ask baby stats to add wet,\nAlexa ask baby stats to add pee\nAlexa, ask baby stats to add meal.\nAlexa, ask baby stats to remove stool.\nAlexa, ask baby stats to delete wet.\nAlexa ask baby stats to remove wet\nAlexa, ask baby stats to decrement meal.\nAlexa, ask baby stats when was the last poop\nAlexa, ask baby stats when was the last pee\nAlexa, ask baby stats what time was the last feeding\nAlexa, ask baby stats to get stats for February 27\nAlexa, ask baby stats to get stats for today\nAlexa, ask baby stats to get stats for this week\nAlexa ask baby stats when was the last {stool, wet, feeding,poop,pee etc..}\nAlexa ask baby stats for the last diaper\nAlexa, ask baby stats to get id",3.6,6,"B01CJRUAF6","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.f24fc1b4-b5f2-4be7-afc7-c833d6c739d6","2016-03-04 04:59:25","baby stats","Alexa ask baby stats to add poo","Alexa ask baby stats when was the last poo","Alexa ask baby stats to get stats for today","http://babystatsapi.azurewebsites.net/privacy.html","","No"

"Jim Rockford's Answering Machine","Entertainment","TexasGovernor.org","The 1970's television detective, Jim Rockford, had an advanced device on his desk (for the time) that would record messages from people calling his office while he was away. Every episode of the Rockford Files began with a different message recorded on Jim Rockford's answering machine.\n\nThe Amazon Alexa is also an advanced device which people talk to and Alexa delivers responses to their queries. In this way, Alexa could be described as an ""Answering Machine."" \n\nJim Rockford's bulking answering machine represented an automation technology that television viewers in 1974 hadn't considered to be accessible to the private individual. The subtle irony was that this fantastic machine's potential was being squandered with having to accurately dictate the ridiculous ramblings of Angel and Rockford's other colorful associates.\n\nWith the ""Jim Rockford Answering Machine"" Alexa skill, you can likewise squander the magnificent potential of your ""Answering Machine"" by conscripting Alexa to read transcriptions from it's ancestor on Jim Rockford's desk. \n\nTo use, just say, ""Ask Jim Rockford's Answering Machine to read a message.""",3,2,"B01D26NANC","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.0b6e6187-82c6-4a0b-938c-17d25f4da64b","2016-03-16 17:18:58","jim rockford's answering machine","Alexa, Ask Jim Rockford's Answering Machine to read a message","Alexa, Ask Jim Rockford's Answering Machine to play a message","Alexa, Ask Jim Rockford's Answering Machine to read messages","","","No"

"L Train","Travel","Nick Mercer","Ask Alexa when the next train is coming to your NYC MTA L train stop, and listen to the current L train status. This app is simply for asking Alexa when the next L train is coming in a particular direction. For example, if you commute to work or school from Brooklyn to Manhattan everyday, Alexa will always be prepared to tell you when the next train is coming, and if there is any service changes you need to know about. After Alexa has guided you through the basic setup, you will get the next two trains that are on their way.\n\nYour first time using The L Train, you will be walked through setting up your first train stop, and the direction on the train you regularly travel. If this is your first time using The L Train, you can just ask the L train when its coming by saying ""Alexa, ask the L Train when it's coming"". Alexa will than ask you for the L train station you use the most.  Example stations are; Jefferson Street, 3rd Avenue or Lorimer Street. After your station is recognized, Alexa will ask you for what direction you regularly travel. Example directions are; Towards Manhattan, Towards Brooklyn, West, East, Canarsie or To Eight Ave. Once we have all your settings, whenever you ask The L Train when its coming, you will get precise times to help you schedule your departure. \n\nIf you would like to reset your settings, you can simply say ""Alexa, ask The L train to reset settings"". This will walk you through the startup process. If you fail to complete the startup process, you will be prompted to complete it on next use.\n\nOnce you are all setup, you can always just say ""Alexa ask the L Train"" or ""Alexa open the L Train"", or even ""Alexa run the L Train"" to get your train times in the fastest way possible.

"Roddenberry's Trek Quotes","Entertainment","Majel Tech","Roddenberry's Trek Quotes is a fun, fast, and fabulous way to reminisce about your favorite Trek moments, get to know the senior TNG crew members better, or just entertain Trekkie guests. Use this skill for pure entertainment value, or use the random quote feature to turn it into a drinking game.\n\nAsk Roddenberry for a quote to hear one of a curated selection of the best crew quotes.\n\nExamples of things you can do are: ask Roddenberry to give you a quote from any senior TNG crew member, ask him to surprise you, or ask him to repeat the previous quote.\n\nUnlike Alexa experiences that use simplistic random algorithms, annoyingly repeating the same responses over and over while there's still more to hear, Roddenberry won't repeat any quotes until you've heard them all. We GUARANTEE he'll play you only unique quotes until you've listened to ALL of them. We've also worked hard to make sure Alexa reads the quotes as naturally, and as close to way the original crew member said them, as possible.\n\nAt Majel Tech, we pride ourselves on our best-in-class language recognition. We've spent a lot of time at thinking up anything you might naturally say in requesting Roddenberry's functionality. Go ahead, try it! We think you'll be pleased.\n\nNote: that being said, we're not perfect! If Alexa starts her response with ""A quote from <crew member>"", that means she believes you requested a quote from a random crew member. If you had actually requested a quote from someone in particular, she misheard you (you can always look at the card in the Alexa app to see for sure which crew member the quote is from). Please try again, and if it doesn't work, let us know! We want to continually improve our language recognition, and your feedback helps us do that! You can use the ""Send Feedback"" link at the bottom of this screen to do so.

"Tennis MatchManager","Health-and-Fitness","Dana Young","Pros play tennis with a human umpire that coordinates flow of the match and keeps score. They get access to detailed stats to analyze and improve their game. Over years, this data provides insights into their own personal game as well as how best to compete or partner with others. \n\nWith Alexa, you can get this kind of experience at the college, club and recreational player level. Every point you play is stored so you can review statistics and trends to improve your game. \n\nTennis MatchManager coordinates both singles and doubles matches. You can sign in so that all match stats are stored for you long term, or skip sign in and just play. Even skipping sign in will allow you to review all the data about that particular match. In addition to the set and match scores, you can also hear how long you played, what percent of  games and individual points were won/lost vs that opponent, and what your win percentage was when serving.\n\nTo get started, just say 'start a match'.  If you would like to have MatchManager keep track of your match data long term, first register by saying 'register a new player'. Registered players can be added to the match by saying 'add a player'. Whether it is singles or doubles, you will have a red team and a blue team. Once you've started a match, the only  thing to do is tell Alexa who wins a point. Do that by saying 'point blue', or 'point red'. All the rest is coordinated and stored by MatchManager. \n\nOnce the match is set up, strap a Voice Remote for Amazon Echo to one of the player's arms. When they tell Alexa who wins a point, she announces it to the court and coordinates play of the match.\n\nNo wifi at the tennis club? Just use your phone as a hotspot. Need a battery for your Echo? Find them on Amazon. Stuck and need some help? More info up at www.TennisMatchManager.com.\n\nBasic things you can say to get started: \n “Start a match”\t\n“Register a new player”\nTo give a point to a player, say “point red”, or “point blue”.\n“Tell me more things I can say”\t\n\t\t\nExamples of more things you can say:\n“What's the score?”\n“Give me a summary of the match” (provides output to the Alexa app as well as verbal)\n“What's the set score?”\n“Who's serve is it?”\n“Tell me some shortcuts”\n“Tell me ways to change the match”\n\nExamples of ways that you can manually override and control the flow of the match:\n“Play with no add scoring”\n“Don't switch sides”\n“Change to blue team serve”\t\n“Change the set score”\n“Blue team won the game”\n“Start a new game”\n“Start a new set”\t\n If the score gets posted incorrectly, just say what the score should be. For example, say “30 All”\n\t\t\nExamples of combining information that will save time:\n“Start a doubles match with blue serve”\n“Add 206-867-5309 to the red team”\n“Register 425-867-5309”\n\nYou can always say “stop”, “cancel” or “exit”.",1,1,"B01BXCJA7C","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.4cd0a8f9-ba04-409f-8fd1-27b329e4e9e1","2016-02-18 16:24:05","keeper","Alexa, use keeper and start a singles match with red team's serve","give me some help","give me a summary of the match","http://tennismatchmanager.com/privacy.html","","No"

"Wink","CONNECTED_HOME","Wink","Say goodbye to fumbling for the light switch when you walk into the dark house with your arms full. Amazon Alexa makes it easier than ever to adjust your Wink-compatible lighting products.  You can use the Wink skill to either turn the lights on/off by saying, for example: \n\n    Alexa, turn on downstairs lamp.\n\nOr dim the lights to a desired setting: \n\n    Alexa, set living room light to 50%.\n\nNote: in order to use Amazon Alexa with Wink-compatible lighting products, you will need the Wink HUB. From there, getting started is easy:\n\n    1. Connect compatible products in your Wink app and set individual names for each lighting product (bedroom lamp, kitchen light, etc.). \n    2. Then, link your Wink account to Echo within the Echo mobile app (Settings > Connected Home > Device Links > Wink).\n    3. From there, say “Alexa, discover new devices.” This can take up to 20 seconds.\n\nYou can also adjust Wink-enabled Nest thermostats with Amazon Alexa either incrementally or to a specific temperature, making in-home climate control easier than ever. Put this Wink skill into action by saying, for example:\n\n    Alexa, increase bedroom by 3 degrees.\n\n    Alexa, set living room to 70 degrees.\n\nNote: as with lighting products, in order to use Amazon Alexa with Wink-enabled Nest Thermostats, you will need the Wink HUB. After a few simple steps, you’re ready to go:\n\n    1. If you haven’t already, first set up your Nest account and name each thermostat you have (living room, bedroom, kitchen, etc.).\n    2. Next, connect your Nest account with your Wink app. Your Nest Thermostat will appear in the Wink app as “[location] + [name] + [the word ‘thermostat’]. ""Home Living Room Thermostat,” for example.\n    3. Then, link your Wink account to Echo within the Alexa mobile app (Settings > Connected Home > Device Links > Wink). \n    4. Finally, say “Alexa, discover devices.” This can take up to 20 seconds. Your Nest Thermostat will then appear in the Alexa app as [name] i.e. “Living Room” or “Bedroom.”",4.4,9,"B01EIQYF3E","amzn1.ask.skill.013efdab-897c-4dff-9728-ac679242d818","2016-04-19 17:46:31","null","","","","http://www.wink.com/legal/","http://www.wink.com/legal/","No"
