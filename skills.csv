"1-Minute Mindfulness",,"GeekGirl Marketing and App Development","**********************************************\nDear Customers, Due to an issue on August 19th, the 1-Minute Mindfulness skill was unavailable for usage and as a result, many customers may have experienced difficulties accessing the skill.  The issue was temporary and we encourage you to try out the skill again.—The Amazon Alexa Team\n**********************************************\nNote: The Alexa Voice Service limits the amount of audio that can be played back to 90 seconds, hence this skill only supports 1 minute today. GOOD NEWS: we are preparing for an update in the coming weeks that will allow for you to request a 3, 5, 10, 15, or 30 minute meditation! Stay Tuned for that update!\n\n1-Minute Mindfulness from Walking Affirmations is a skill that allows you to take a break from the world around you and enter into a one minute sound meditation. Practicing mindfulness improves both mental and physical health. Mindfulness involves both concentration (a form of meditation) and acceptance. Many people struggle with how to begin meditating and get the rewards of a more contemplative life, so this skill is the perfect way to start a meditation practice. You can change your life, and change the world... one minute at a time. \n\nAs your meditation begins, remember all you have to do is focus on your breath. However this is harder than it seems. As your mind begins to wander, notice it, accept it lovingly and return your focus to your breathing. Its a little like training a puppy. As your mind thinks of other things, lovingly and gently return the focus to your breath. In time you will be able to stay present and focused for the full length of time. \n\nThere are several different meditations available. You can ask for a peaceful meditation or one with specific sounds. You can ask for a quick meditation or a forest meditation. You can also ask for a river meditation. Each of these one minute meditations will play a related meditative soundtrack to help you tune out the world and focus on your breath.\n\nHere are some examples of what you can say:\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a quick meditation""\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a 1 minute meditation""\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a minute meditation""\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a peaceful meditation""\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a river meditation""\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a forest meditation""",2.2,327,"B01BN1DYBQ","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.d5cd74c4-4884-41fe-a8af-d9330a2fd53e","2016-02-10 17:37:51","mindfulness","Alexa, Ask Mindfulness for a minute meditation.","Alexa, Ask Mindfulness for a forest meditation.","Alexa, Ask Mindfulness for a peaceful meditation.","https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/7758923","","No"

This skill attempts to translate the METAR data to be as close to ATIS as possible. This means using ICAO aviation phonetics where appropriate and translating wind directions from true-north referenced (METAR) to magnetic-north referenced (ATIS).\n\nThere are two ways to specify the station you want to hear. The first is by city name. (The app does not currently understand airport names.) The second is by a three or four letter ICAO airport identifier. If you only provide three letters, the skill prepends a 'K' -- that is, it assumes you are referencing a US airport. You can specify any airport worldwide by providing all four letters. The letters must be provided using ICAO phonetics (alpha, bravo, charlie, etc.)\n\n\n\nThere are also a couple of experimental features you might try, but are not fully tested as yet:\n\n- Get the time in Zulu, like this:\n\n ""Alexa, ask airport weather to report zulu time""\n\n- set a default airport \n \nFirst, use the app, specifying an airport as usual.

"Almond",,"Securifi Inc.","Almond brings its Wi-Fi and SmartHome controls to Alexa with features such as Parental controls, Guest Networks, Scenes and Modes.\n\nHave kids? Almond offers enhanced Wi-Fi features for Alexa like Parental Controls. Blocking your kids’ devices is as easy as saying “Alexa, tell Almond to disable kids Internet.” Sorry kids. You’re welcome mom and dad.\n\nHaving a party? Everyone’s going to ask you for Wi-Fi access. Not a problem. You can enable and disable the guest network with a simple voice command like “Alexa, tell Almond to enable guest network” and have the guest Wi-Fi username and password sent to you via email. You can share this with your guests as you like.\n\nScenes enable you to perform a series of simultaneous actions with a single voice command. For example a single scene can dim all the lights and set the temperature just right for that special dinner date. To activate a scene named 'Dinner' say, ""Alexa, tell Almond to activate Dinner Scene"" or say, ""Alexa, tell Almond to set Dinner Scene"". \n\nWhat’s more, you can also activate and easily switch between Almond's two types of modes: Home and Away using commands like “Alexa, tell Almond to be in Home mode”' or “Alexa, I'm going away.” Modes are key to automating your home and home security. They let you choose what devices are automatically triggered as part of the home automation rules you create in the Almond App.\n\nPlease note the minimum requirements for using Alexa with Almond:\nYou have an Almond +/Almond 2015 router with the updated firmware.\nAlmond+ : AP2-R089-L009-W016-ZW016-ZB005\nAlmond 2015 : AL2-R095\n\nYour mobile App (iOS/Android) is updated to the latest version.\nAlmond v6.81b on Android\nAlmond v2.4.2 on iOS\n\nAn Almond account that you can create using the Almond App.\n\nSETUP: Enable the skill on Alexa and use your Almond account credentials to login",3.5,4,"B01BLPITFK","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.0afff5d3-1615-4c87-af8d-f9e116998d33","2016-02-09 11:06:04","almond","Alexa, tell Almond to enable Guest Wi-Fi","Alexa, tell Almond to stop Kids Internet","Alexa, tell Almond to activate Party Scene","https://connect.securifi.com/prpo","https://connect.securifi.com/tou","No"

Find more information about connecting Smart Home devices at http://amzn.to/291lR7u\nWhen using the skill, you need to specify by name which device or sensor to use. There are two ways to define this/these names:\n• Use the name(s) you set up already – these are shown in the Almond app and can be changed, or\n• Create an Alexa group, like Bedroom or Downstairs, and add the device(s) or sensor(s) to the group. More information at http://amzn.to/2965dCE\n\nOnce you know the name or group of your device(s), you can say the following: \n* If you have switches or non-dimmable lights, you can turn them on/off, for example: “Alexa, turn on my Bedroom lights”.\n* If you have dimmable lights, you can change the brightness, for example: “Alexa, brighten Downstairs to 60 percent"", or ""Alexa, dim the Living Room lights"".\n* If you have thermostats, you can change the temperature, for example: “Alexa, lower Bedroom by 3 degrees”, or “Alexa, set Downstairs temperature to 72”.\n\nFor more advanced router features such as controlling guest network, blocking devices, and activating scenes and modes, go to the Skills section in the Alexa App, search for the ‘Almond’ skill and enable it.

If a station has less than 3 bikes available, Bike Share will also let you know  the next station that is more populated. \n\nFirst, you need to add the address where your Amazon Echo resides. Start by saying:\n""Add an Address.""\n\nAlexa will prompt you, step by step, to add your address, starting with your house number. For example, if your address was 350 5th Avenue, 10118, when prompted for your house number, you would say ""three fifty"".\n\nNext, Bike Share will ask for your street name. Using the above example address, you would say ""fifth avenue"".\n\nFinally, Bike Share will ask for your zip code. In the above example, you would answer, ""one zero one one eight"".\n\nOnce saved, you can then ask at any time to find the closest bike. Just say: ""find me a bike.""\nAlexa will remember your address indefinitely, so you'll never need to add an address again unless you move your Echo. \n\nIf you need to change your address, just tell Bike Share: ""change my address"".

"Chicago Bus Stop",,"SG Technologies","Get up to the minute bus tracking info right from the CTA's Bus Tracker API before you leave the house.\n\nThe quickest way to get bus info is to tell Alexa the bus stop number.  Alexa will reply with how many buses are en route and what time they're estimated to arrive.  \n\nDon't know your bus stop number?  It's on the bus stop sign.  Not standing in front of your bus stop sign?  You can use their online bus tracker.  Select your stop and you'll see the stop number listed in the ""Find By Stop #"" box in the top left under the logo.\n\nhttp://www.ctabustracker.com/bustime/eta/eta.jsp\n\nYou can also give Alexa the direction, route number, and cross streets/stop name to get estimates.  If you choose to use this method currently you'll need to know the exact name of the stop/cross streets that the CTA uses in their API.  Typically it's the bus route's street name first then the cross street.  For example if you're wanting the northbound 22 bus at Addison you'd need to request ""...northbound 22 bus at Clark & Addison.""  If you're looking for stops like ""Fullerton Red Line"" you're not going to have a good time :/ CTA has it as 'Fullerton & Sheffield (Red/Brown/Purple Line)'.

For example, in the ME route the station name '55th - 56th - 57th St.' is how the name is published.  But you cannot say, '55th space dash space 56th space dash  etc'.  So I have tried to add aliases for these kinds of stations.  If your station is not recognized, send me an email with the route, station name, and what you know the station as and I will add an alias for that station for you.\n \n\nThe issues concerning the app not working was caused by an interruption with retrieving the train schedule data.

"DC Metro Tracker",,"Sean Simpson","Get the most up to date Metro Rail information to stay on top of your Washington, DC commute! Optionally set a default home station to make retrieving Metro info even easier. \n\n============\n**NEW**\n============\nIntegration with www.ismetroonfire.com: Ask Alexa whether the metro is currently on fire! See below for details.\n\n============\nFEATURES:\n============\n* HOME STATION ~ Set a default home station simply by saying something like ""Alexa, ask Metro Tracker to set Metro Center as my home station."" Once you have set a home station, Metro Tracker will assume your departure station is your home station unless another departure station is specified. Change your home station at any time simply by re-using the ""set home station"" command. \n\n* LIST TRAINS ~ list all trains scheduled to arrive at a particular station. Try saying ""Alexa, ask Metro Tracker to list all trains arriving at Farragut West""\n\n* FILTER LINE ~ Tell Alexa which metro line you are interested in to only receive train times for that particular line. For example, try: ""Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for the next red line from Gallery Place.""\n\n* FILTER DIRECTIONS ~ Specify a destination to only get trains traveling in the direction you need. Try saying ""Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for the next train from Union Station to Dupont Circle.""\n\n* AVOID EARLY OFF-LOADING ~ Specifying a destination will return times only for trains going *at least* as far as you need. For example, asking for trains going from Union Station to Dupont Circle will *not* return times for trains only going as far as Farragut North.\n\n* COMMUTE TIMES ~ Get an estimate of how long it usually takes to travel between station A and station B. For example, try saying: ""Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for a commute estimate between L'Enfant Plaza and Columbia Heights,"" or ""Alexa, ask Metro Tracker how long it would take to get to Clarendon from Metro Center.""\n\n*ON FIRE? ~ Find out whether the metro is currently on fire! Just say something like ""Alexa, ask Metro Tracker if the metro is on fire,"" and Alexa will query www.ismetroonfire.com to give you the latest report. Hopefully most of the time the answer is no, but if smoke or fire has been reported on any metro lines, Alexa will let you know and tell you which lines are affected. \nShout out to Nick Stocchero, creator of ismetroonfire.com, for making this feature possible. Be sure to follow @ismetroonfire on Twitter to get tweet updates from his website!\n\n============\nBUGS:\n============\nIf you notice any bugs or problems with the app that should be fixed, or if there is a feature you would like to see added in the future, please send an email to dcmetrotracker@gmail.com\n\n============\nNOTES:\n============\n*Metro Tracker only relays information for trains that are at least one minute away. As such, trains that are currently boarding or arriving are not reported when you ask Metro Tracker for train times. This is done in order to make the output more concise, and only give you train times you can actually use (the vast majority of users do not live close enough to a metro station for info on trains currently boarding or arriving to be of use).\n\n*The transit info for Metro Tracker comes directly from the WMATA database that keeps track of all trains in the Metro system. This is generally highly reliable, but the recent safetrack initiative has resulted in some trains along affected routes being excluded from the database. Thus, it's possible there may be a train or two traveling the rails that Metro Tracker doesn't know about.\n\n*If at any time the app responds with ""there is a ghost train to a ghost station..."" this means that there is a train scheduled to arrive, but the WMATA database has no information on what line it belongs to, or where it is going. These are the trains that show up as ""--- --- TRAIN"" on the train arrival boards of metro platforms. Ghost trains sometimes have arrival times associated with them, and sometimes not.",3.1,7,"B01EYZBO38","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.48d300b5-e643-4150-aaff-f8d1b92ed568","2016-05-06 18:08:36","metro tracker","Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for the next orange line to Vienna from Metro Center","Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for delays on the red line","Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for a commute estimate between Metro Center and the airport","","","No"

Your character's attributes will affect how well your character does during the adventure giving you bonus modifiers that add or subtract from your rolls. You will start in town where you can purchase various weapons, armors, potions and spells to help you during your adventure. You will encounter various types of monsters in the dungeon that you can attack and kill which will give your character experience points that will be used to level up your character.\n\nAlexa will save your character and your dungeon state for you so that you can continue from where you left off (even if you are in the middle of fighting a monster). Dungeon Adventure is a game meant to be played over many sessions and if you die you can always come back and try again with a new character and dungeon environment (and maybe try a different strategy).\n\nIt will be a difficult task to find the evil necromancer and slay him but if you do it you will go down in the dungeon adventure HALL OF FAME. \n\nHelpful Tips:\n\n- Have some healing potions to drink\n- Go back to town after you've acquired more gold to purchase better weapons, armor, potions and spells\n- Keep track of your current hit points (you can always ask ""How many hit points do I have?"")\n- Kill monsters to gain experience points to level up your character (you can always ask ""How many experience points do I have?"")\n- You can drink potions, cast spells, run, open chests, etc even in combat if it is your turn\n- Use MONSTER INFO to help determine how powerful the monster is by getting its stats\n- Sometimes it is better to try to run from a monster than continue fighting\n- you can EXAMINE chests for traps before opening them and if you discover a trap you can try to DISARM it\n- You can always relaunch dungeon adventure and pick up where you left the game\n- You can always interrupt Alexa by saying Alexa and then say what you want to do\n- You will die!\n\nSome of the useful things you can say:\n\nWHERE AM I / LOOK AROUND\nGO / MOVE / TRAVEL / RUN / EVADE (north, west, east, south, etc)\n\nWHAT IS MY (strength, dexterity, intelligence, armor class, level, etc)\n\nHOW MANY (hit points, experience points, etc) DO I HAVE\nHOW MUCH (gold, etc) DO I HAVE\n\nWHAT (weapons, armors, potions, spells, etc) DO I HAVE\nEQUIP / READY / PULL OUT (weapon name)\nWHAT WEAPON AM I USING\n\nWEAR / CHANGE INTO (armor name)\nWHAT ARMOR AM I WEARING\n\nLIST (weapons, armors, potions, spells) FOR SALE\nPURCHASE (item name)\n\nATTACK HIGH, MIDDLE, LOW\n\nDEFEND HIGH, MIDDLE, LOW\n\nHOW MANY HIT POINTS DOES THE (monster) HAVE LEFT\n\nDRINK POTION OF (potion name)\n\nCAST (spell name) SPELL\n\nOPEN CHEST\n\nEXAMINE CHEST FOR TRAPS\nDISARM CHEST TRAP\n\nMONSTER INFO / MONSTER STATS\n\nCALL ME (character name)\nWHAT IS MY CHARACTER'S NAME\n\nLISTEN\n\nGAME STATS\n\nWHO IS IN THE HALL OF FAME\n\nWHAT IS MY CURRENT STATUS\n\nINVENTORY\n\nCHARACTER SHEET\n\nemail: dragula[at]lastridehearse[dot]net",4,6,"B01K457ZUS","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.83c405e9-0b21-45e7-a10e-5905632e5d24","2016-08-12 02:37:44","dungeon adventure","Alexa, start dungeon adventure","Alexa, open dungeon adventure","Alexa, begin dungeon adventure","","","No"

Nanotechnology, terraforming, Zero-G living, upgrading animal sapience, and reputation systems are all used as plot points and background.\n\nWith all of this, the game encourages players to confront existential threats like aliens, weapons of mass destruction, Exsurgent Virus outbreaks, and political unrest.\n\nData for this Skill has been sourced from Eclipse Phase materials under the Creative Commons License (http://eclipsephase.com/cclicense)\n\nPlease support this game and its fans by visiting, http://eclipsephase.com.

Using HCA you can control, program, and schedule lights and appliances using many popular automation protocols. \n\nUnlike other home control systems, HCA is designed not to just control your home but also to program it. You don't need to accept the simple ""control a device"" using voice offered by some automation solutions. Using HCA you can create an automation solution that responds to your needs by combining multiple device in complex scenarios involving events, time, location, state of the home, etc. into one program. These programs express your intent of how your installation should work.\n\nIn addition to voice control, HCA offers clients for the iPad, iPhone, Android devices, and WIndows. With these client applications you are not locked into an application that displays as it wants to. You can create the page structure you see when interacting with the HCA client on your mobile device.  This can be configured on a device-by-device basis and on a user-by-user basis.  For some users, the display can show a complete set of pages for each room. For other users it can display a smaller set of only selected devices. For least technical users you can create a simple keypad like interface that offers only those actions you want to make available for them.\n\nIn one inclusive package HCA provides for creation and operation of simple to complex automation designs. \n\nThe top 20 feature list:\n\n1. Integrates Insteon, UPB, and other power line technologies\n2. Supports IP addressed IR interfaces\n3. Supports whole-house wireless\n4. Can be used in a client-server mode with multiple simultaneous read-write clients for complete local and remote access to design\n5. Amazon Alexa interaction\n6.

Constructed in a graphical manner from over 60 different actions\n9. Supports text based scripts in any scripting language that can utilize the extensive HCA object model\n10. Control interface creates a simplified control oriented user interface\n11. Integrate into the HCA user Interface views of other applications: security, power management, and cameras using HTML views\n12. Send email and SMS messages as part of a program action\n13.

There are two ways to define name(s):\n- Use the name(s) you set up already – these are shown in the Philips Hue app 'Room' tab and can be changed, or\n- Create an Alexa group, like Bedroom or Downstairs, and add the device(s) to the group.

To control scenes, simply tell Alexa to turn on a <scene name> in the <room name>.  For example, ""Alexa, turn on Relax in the Bedroom""\n- Scene names can be found in the Philips Hue app 'Room' tab after you select a specific room.  Feel free to create new scenes that work just for you!\n- After creating or renaming a scene, simply say, ""Alexa, discover devices""\n\nIn case you still have some questions, see the FAQ: http://www2.meethue.com/en-US/support/faq-categories/partners/amazon-alexa/",2.2,143,"B01LWAGUG7","amzn1.ask.skill.561d802b-454e-4808-9e23-750ef4273b12","2016-10-08 03:41:41",,"","","","http://www2.meethue.com/en-US/privacy-policy","http://www2.meethue.com/en-US/productterms","No"

"Hunt the Yeti",,"James Church","Hunt the Yeti (or Yeti Hunt) is an interpretation of the game Hunt The Wumpus (1972). In this game, you guide a hunter through a dark cave to discover the location of the yeti. Once you have helped the hunter locate the yeti, tell the hunter to throw the hunter's only spear in the direction of the yeti. If you are right about the location, you will help the hunter defeat the yeti! If not, the yeti will eventually find the hunter.\n\nIn this version of the game, the hunter is lost in a 5 by 5 cave. There are open pits, bats, and a single yeti. You hear the bats flutter, feel the breeze from the open pit, or smell the yeti near by. Bats will pick the hunter up and drop the hunter in a random (safe) location. If the hunter falls into a pit, the hunter dies and the game is over. If the hunter walks into the yeti, the yeti attacks and the hunter dies. Only the hunter is capable of moving, but the hunter only has one spear, so make it count!\n\nGame features:\n- ""begin game"": Starts a new game.\n- ""how to play"": Reminds the player how to play.\n- ""overview"": Provides a short overview of Hunt the Yeti.\n- ""pause"": Provides a short prompt and allows the player to think.\n\nOnce you are playing the game, there are two actions to remember:\n\n- ""move [direction]"": Moves the hunter in a particular direction.\n- ""throw [direction]"": Throws the spear in a particular direction.\n\nA direction is always north, south, east, or west. The game will guide you about where open rooms are, but it won't tell you what are in those rooms. It's up to you to use deductive reasoning to figure out where the Yeti and other traps are located. Good luck!\n\nYou may also say a direction and the hunter will automatically move in that direction. (For some reason, I have trouble moving the hunter ""south"". Maybe it's an issue with my accent. For that case, I say ""move south"".)\n\nFull source code and acknowledgements are on the game's GitHub page:\nhttps://github.com/jcchurch/HuntTheYetiAlexa",4.6,13,"B01JRE35FG","amzn1.ask.skill.cd76cca4-65d0-4df4-994e-49430b7ed7ed","2016-08-10 06:37:41","yeti hunt game","Alexa, launch Yeti Hunt Game","begin game","move north","","","No"

Practice ascending and descending interval ear training while you have a few minutes simply by saying ""give me an interval"", after that, Alexa will keep score for you and update you on your score as you go. \n\nTo ensure proper ear training and an un-biased key center, random starting notes are chosen. After each guess, feedback about your answer being right or not is given; and you're updated with your current score after a few attempts. Be sure to use the correct music interval terms: unison, minor second, major second, minor third, major third, perfect fourth, tritone, perfect fifth, minor sixth, major sixth, minor seventh, major seventh, and octave.\n\nAfter initializing IntervalTrainer with your first interval (""Alexa, as Interval Trainer to give me an interval""), reply back with that interval name (""perfect fourth""), and Alexa will confirm or reject your answer.\n\nTo switch interval directions, simply say ""switch interval direction to descending"" or ""switch interval direction to ascending"".\n\nYou can start over your scoring by saying ""reset score"" and you'll have a fresh scorecard.",5,3,"B01EMAVSP4","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.636a33b3-d9eb-4076-ac51-2769dac46135","2016-04-28 01:38:32","interval trainer","Alexa ask Interval Trainer to give me an interval","Alexa ask Interval Trainer for a descending interval","Alexa ask Interval Trainer","","","No"

"L Train",,"Nick Mercer","Ask Alexa when the next train is coming to your NYC MTA L train stop, and listen to the current L train status. This app is simply for asking Alexa when the next L train is coming in a particular direction. For example, if you commute to work or school from Brooklyn to Manhattan everyday, Alexa will always be prepared to tell you when the next train is coming, and if there is any service changes you need to know about. After Alexa has guided you through the basic setup, you will get the next two trains that are on their way.\n\nYour first time using The L Train, you will be walked through setting up your first train stop, and the direction on the train you regularly travel. If this is your first time using The L Train, you can just ask the L train when its coming by saying ""Alexa, ask the L Train when it's coming"". Alexa will than ask you for the L train station you use the most.  Example stations are; Jefferson Street, 3rd Avenue or Lorimer Street. After your station is recognized, Alexa will ask you for what direction you regularly travel. Example directions are; Towards Manhattan, Towards Brooklyn, West, East, Canarsie or To Eight Ave. Once we have all your settings, whenever you ask The L Train when its coming, you will get precise times to help you schedule your departure. \n\nIf you would like to reset your settings, you can simply say ""Alexa, ask The L train to reset settings"". This will walk you through the startup process. If you fail to complete the startup process, you will be prompted to complete it on next use.\n\nOnce you are all setup, you can always just say ""Alexa ask the L Train"" or ""Alexa open the L Train"", or even ""Alexa run the L Train"" to get your train times in the fastest way possible. But you an always use more complete phrasing like, ""Alexa, ask the L Train when it's coming?"".\n\nThis skill works for every L train stop in New York City, including Brooklyn and Queens.",4.2,7,"B019YQ846M","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.90c30b6a-6ff7-499c-be12-86a8516cea8b","2015-12-29 18:40:51","the l train","Alexa, ask the L Train when it's coming?","Alexa, open the L Train.","Alexa, ask the L Train to reset settings.","http://nmercer.github.io/TheLTrainPrivacyPolicy/","","No"

"Morse Coder",,"Kay Lerch","This skill makes you an expert for Morse codes. You can explore three different features.\n\n1) Encode names to Morse code\n===============================\nIf you are interested in Morse codes expressing common US first names, go for something like:\n\n""Alexa, ask Morse Coder to encode <FirstName>"" \n\nwhere <FirstName> is any common first name of your choice.\n\nWith this intent Alexa plays back the corresponding Morse code. Moreover, this skill provides the Morse code to your Alexa App.\nDue to technical limitations by Amazon on audio tags this feature is only supported for names shorter than sixteen letters.\n \n2) Spell out names in Morse code\n===============================\nSimilar to the encode feature of Morse Coder this feature lets Alexa spell out a common US first name of your choice in Morse code. \nThe spell-out feature is designed for newcomers who want to learn Morse code letter by letter. Try out:\n\n""Alexa, spell out <FirstName>"" \n\nwhere <FirstName> is any common US first name of your choice. Once again Alexa even returns the Morse code to your Alexa App.\nDue to technical limitations by Amazon on audio tags this feature is only supported for names shorter than six letters.\n\n3) Exercises / Learn Morse Code\n===============================\nAs soon as you got the basics on Morse codes you can test your comprehension. Start an exercise by saying:\n\n""Alexa, start exercise""\n\nand Alexa starts playing a Morse code and asks you to decode and pronounce the word being played. If Alexa doesn't get what you're saying, try to spell the correct answer.\nIf you are not sure Alexa tries to help you by slowing down the playback speed of the code as soon as you give a wrong answer or wait for several seconds without giving an answer. \nAnother option to simplify things for you is to look in your Alexa App. There you can find the written Morse code along with a spelled version of it (""Di-dah-dit ..."").\nActually the Alexa App is the best resource for you while exercising as you can learn a lot from the cards provided by the Morse Coder.\nOptionally you can skip or cancel an exercise by saying ""Next"" or ""Cancel"". If you need help free to ask for ""Help"" at any time. If you want to listen to a code again, just ask Alexa to ""Repeat"". \nYou can interrupt an exercise at any time by using one of the above features (""Spell out <FirstName>"", ""Encode <FirstName>"") and get back to the exercise just by expressing your guess to last played code. Also ""Repeat"" brings you back to the exercise.\nThe capability of switching between an exercise and the other features helps you researching for the correct answer. \n\nScoring\nFor each word you decode correctly you get points which sum up in your personal score. The score persists throughout one session. \nAlexa starts with asking you to decode a randomly picked word with five letters. \nIf you guess the word, Alexa increases the length of the next word. Otherwise Alexa decreases the length to make things easier for you. \nWords in Morse Coder have a minimum length of three characters and a maximum length of eight characters. \nThe longer a word the more points you get out of an answer. Wrong answers on the other hand could degrade your score. \n\nIf you are switching between the features your score persists and doesn't get lost.\n\n4) General features\n===============================\n""Repeat"" during an exercise plays back a code again in a slower version. It also is an option to get back to your exercise if you switched to the spell-out or encode feature.\n""Next"" or ""Start over"" at any time should guide you to the next random code. The current exercise will be skipped.\n""Stop"" quits the skill and stops the exercise. You are provided with your final score.\n""Help"" gives some information on what to say.\n""Cancel"" stops the current exercise. Alexa will give you the correct word for the current code and asks you to continue with another code.",3.8,7,"B01G4F0B4O","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.c26b1c82-967e-4807-b1c2-e983e820edf1","2016-05-26 06:08:35","morse coder","Alexa, tell morse coder to teach me","Alexa, ask morse coder to encode Michael","Alexa, ask morse coder to spell out the name James","","","No"

It will also give you an estimate of how long it would take to make the trip! \n\nUsing Nav  Ninja is easy and can be accomplished two different ways. The first method is through a rich interactive conversation - simply ask Alexa to open Nav  Ninja and then answer Alexa’s questions. If you make a mistake don’t worry, Alexa will confirm your choices and even let you “go back” or “start over”. If you need to exit at any time simply say “cancel”. If you are unsure of a question, feel free to say “help”. \n\nOnce you get a hang of the app you may want answers more quickly. The second method allows you to provide all of the information up front and get your answer right away! You simply need to supply two cities and an optional transportation mode (driving, bicycling, or walking).

"PingPong Showdown",,"Dana Young","Got a ping pong table? Let Alexa keep score and make the game even more fun with her wisecracks. This is a full featured skill with more than 25 interactions. Alexa is a great score keeper, but lookout for her sharp humor! She has a sass-meter, so you can adjust it from 0 (off) to 10 (full up). She never forgets the score or when to switch serving. In fact every point and every game you play is stored for bragging rights against rivals. \n\nYou can play both singles and doubles matches. You can sign in so that all match stats are stored for you, or skip sign-in and just play. In addition to the game and match scores, you can also hear what percent of  games and individual points were won/lost vs that opponent, what your win percentage was when serving, and what your longest point streak of the match was.\n\nTo get started, first register by saying 'register a new player'. Then just say, 'Use ping pong and start a match'. Whether it is singles or doubles, you will have a red team and a blue team. Once you've started a match, the only thing to do is tell Alexa who wins a point. Do that by saying 'point blue', or 'point red'. All the rest is coordinated by Alexa. \n\nWhen doing the one-time registration, you will choose a 4-digit number for your player ID and tell Alexa your first name. Then when starting a match, Alexa will prompt players for their IDs and kick off the match.\n\n\nBasic things you can say to get started: \n “Start a match”\n “Start a doubles match”\n “Set the sass-meter to zero.” (0-10)\t\n “Tell me the rules of ping pong”\n“Register a new player”\n “Undo that”\t\nTo give a point to a player, say “Point Red”, or “Point Blue”.\n“Tell me more things I can say”\t\n\t\t\nExamples of more things you can say:\n“What's the score?”\n“Give me a summary of the match” (provides output to the Alexa app as well as verbal)\n“What's the match score?”\n“Who's serve is it?”\n“Tell me how to set preferences”\n“Tell me ways to change the match”\n\nExamples of ways that you can manually override and control the flow of the match:\n“Play games to 21” (or 11)\n“Play best three out of five”\n“Play best three out of five” \n“Play a single game match”  \n“Change the number of serves per turn” (to either 2 or 5)\n“Don't switch sides”\t\n“Change the score”\n“Start a new game”\n\nHere are ways that you can set preferences for what Alexa says during the match:\n“Keep it short” This cuts down on the things Alexa says.\n“Don't switch sides”\n\nYou can save and load your match preferences. Preferences include:\n- Playing to either 11 or 21 points in a game\n- Playing matches with either one game, or best three out of five games\n- Setting of the sass-meter between 0-10\n- Switching sides after serve (on/off)\n- Experienced user mode, where comments are kept short\n\nWhen you say, Save Preferences, the settings of the current match will be stored in your profile. \nTo load your preferences, say, Load Preferences after starting a new match.\n\nYou can always say “stop”, “cancel” or “exit”.",3.6,2,"B01ESOHSLC","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.8cbbec55-1a6a-4eaf-b2f8-c898f8a6be37","2016-07-01 05:57:53","ping pong","Alexa, use pingpong and start a match","what are my options?","register a new player","http://pingpong-showdown.appspot.com/privacy.html","","No"

Use this skill for pure entertainment value, or use the random quote feature to turn it into a drinking game.\n\nAsk Roddenberry for a quote to hear one of a curated selection of the best crew quotes.\n\nExamples of things you can do are: ask Roddenberry to give you a quote from any senior TNG crew member, ask him to surprise you, or ask him to repeat the previous quote.\n\nUnlike Alexa experiences that use simplistic random algorithms, annoyingly repeating the same responses over and over while there's still more to hear, Roddenberry won't repeat any quotes until you've heard them all. We GUARANTEE he'll play you only unique quotes until you've listened to ALL of them. We've also worked hard to make sure Alexa reads the quotes as naturally, and as close to way the original crew member said them, as possible.\n\nAt Majel Tech, we pride ourselves on our best-in-class language recognition. We've spent a lot of time at thinking up anything you might naturally say in requesting Roddenberry's functionality. Go ahead, try it! We think you'll be pleased.\n\nNote: that being said, we're not perfect! If Alexa starts her response with ""A quote from <crew member>"", that means she believes you requested a quote from a random crew member. If you had actually requested a quote from someone in particular, she misheard you (you can always look at the card in the Alexa app to see for sure which crew member the quote is from).

"Smart Cap",,"Tushar","(Requires Raspberry Pi/Dragonboard). Instructions given on the github page mentioned at the end of this description.\n\nWhy:\n\nThere are about 285 million visually impaired people in the world. They are not able to experience the world the way we do. Smart cap aims to provide this missing experience for them. The system uses state of the art deep learning techniques from Microsoft Cognitive Services for image classification and tagging. \n\nWhat:\n\nThe smart cap aims bring the beautiful world as a narrative to the visually impaired. The narrative is generated by converting the scenes in front of them to text which describes the important objects in the scene. Examples of text include 'A group of people playing a game of football', 'yellow truck parked next to the car', a bowl of salad kept on table'. For the first prototype of the system, one line along with some keywords would be played as an audio to the users but in the later versions a detailed description would be added as the feature.\n\nHow:\n\nThe architecture of the system includes Amazon Alexa, Raspberry Pi and online computer vision API's. \n\nA webcam which is retrofitted into a regular cap is connected to the Raspberry Pi. The code give on the github page (mentioned in testing instructions) runs of Raspberry Pi. The function of the code is to capture the image from the webcam and send it to Microsoft API's for recognition task. The response is then inserted to DynamoDB. \nWhen the user asks Alexa to describe the scene, the Alexa Skills Kit triggers Amazon Lambda function to fetch the data from the database (DynamoDB). The correct text is the played as an audio on the Alexa device.\n\n\n#Testing instructions\n1. Speak to Amazon Echo - ""Alexa start smart cap"" (you should hear the response as: ""Sure, You can ask me to describe the scene"")\n2. Speak to Amazon Echo - ""Alexa ask smart cap"" -wait- ""describe the scene"""" (you should hear the response as: ""No data received from device in past one minute""). This makes sure that the Alexa skills kit and dynamoDb are working as expected.\n3. Get the userId. Speak to Amazon Echo - ""Alexa ask smart cap to get the user info"" (you should hear a long code)\n4. Open http://alexa.amazon.com/ and login\n5. In the userId card, you would see a long string\n6. Copy the userId and paste it in aws_dynamodb.py file\n7. Make sure you have python 2.7.9 +. [Terminal] which python. [Terminal] python --version\n8. [Terminal] Run camera_image.py: python camera_image.py (You should see the images in the same folder)\n9. [Terminal] Run ms_visionapi.py: python ms_visionapi.py (You should see the results in the terminal)\n10. [Terminal] Run aws_dynamodb.py: sudo python aws_dynamosb.py (Note: this might require sudo access depending on if you used sudo while doing aws configure.

"Sous Chef Recipes",,"backwardsE LLC","This skill is for the modern home cook who uses their phone as their primary recipe source.  The problem with using your phone as a cook book is that you constantly have to use your hands to turn it on.  This usually involves having to wash and dry your hands, then you have to enter your password because your fingerprint reader doesn't work with damp digits.  It's a huge pain, but no more!\n\nNow you can access your recipes with simple spoken commands.  Simply use the Sous Chef Recipes App available in the Apple App Store and on Google Play to enter your recipes.  Then use your Amazon Alexa enabled device to interact with your recipes in a totally natural way.\n\nOnce you've linked your email address to the app and this skill the first thing you'll want to do is add a recipe.  The app allows you to easily load recipes from the most popular food websites.  Note some websites may require their own login.  You can also load recipes from smaller websites like blogs or enter your own recipes manually as well.\n\nOnce you've added a recipe you'll want to open it.  You can do this in the app or you can simply ask Alexa to do it for you:\n\n""Alexa tell Sous Chef to open the burger sauce recipe.""\n\nHint: Sous is a French word that sounds like the English name Sue.\n\nYou can also check what recipe is open.\n\n“Alexa ask Sous Chef what my current recipe is.”\n\nOnce your recipe is open you'll be able to interact with the ingredients.  Here are some examples of things you can say:\n\n“Alexa tell Sous Chef to list ingredients.”\n\n“Alexa ask Sous Chef how much baking powder.”\n\n“Alexa ask Sous Chef how many potatoes.”\n\nHint: if Alexa doesn't find what you're looking for but you know it's there use the app to simplify the text.  For example you might change “¼ cup (4 oz) unsalted butter melted and cooled” to “4 ounces unsalted butter”.\n\nNext you'll want to go through the steps of the recipe.  For example you can use the following commands:\n\n“Alexa tell Sous Chef to go to the first step.”\n\n“Alexa tell Sous Chef to go to the next step.”\n\n“Alexa tell Sous Chef to go to the fourth step.”\n\n“Alexa tell Sous Chef to repeat step.”\n\nHint: while Alexa is talking you can say “Alexa stop” at any time.  Unfortunately at this time you can't resume from where you left off but hopefully that is a feature we can add in the near future.\n\nRecipes in the Sous Chef App also have a description and notes.  You can access these by asking Alexa to read them aloud:\n\n“Alexa tell Sous Chef to read the description.”\n\n“Alexa tell Sous Chef to read notes.”\n\nHint: Sous Chef will get better at recognizing your recipes over time.  The more recipes that are added the more text we'll have to analyze to improve our speech recognition models.\n\nThat's all there is to it, hands free recipe access at your command.  It's like having your own personal assistant in the kitchen.  With all of Alexa's other great cooking features like timers and measurement conversions you'll be cooking with ease in no time.\n\nPlease use the app to contact us with any questions or comments you may have.  More features are coming soon but let us know if you have any requests.\n\nSavour!\nSous Chef",1,3,"B01LYK4FI5","amzn1.ask.skill.39d8c2eb-b161-4249-80fa-c8a8c3960035","2016-10-10 07:11:44","sous chef","Alexa tell Sous Chef to open the Pad Thai recipe.","Alexa ask Sous Chef how much salt.","Alexa tell Sous Chef to go to the second step.","http://souschef.recipes/privacy.html","http://souschef.recipes/tos.html","No"

"Tennis MatchManager",,"Dana Young","Pros play tennis with a human umpire that coordinates flow of the match and keeps score. They get access to detailed stats to analyze and improve their game. Over years, this data provides insights into their own personal game as well as how best to compete or partner with others. \n\nWith Alexa, you can get this kind of experience at the college, club and recreational player level. Every point you play is stored so you can review statistics and trends to improve your game. \n\nTennis MatchManager coordinates both singles and doubles matches. You can sign in so that all match stats are stored for you long term, or skip sign in and just play. Even skipping sign in will allow you to review all the data about that particular match. In addition to the set and match scores, you can also hear how long you played, what percent of  games and individual points were won/lost vs that opponent, and what your win percentage was when serving.\n\nTo get started, just say 'start a match'.  If you would like to have MatchManager keep track of your match data long term, first register by saying 'register a new player'. Registered players can be added to the match by saying 'add a player'. Whether it is singles or doubles, you will have a red team and a blue team. Once you've started a match, the only  thing to do is tell Alexa who wins a point. Do that by saying 'point blue', or 'point red'. All the rest is coordinated and stored by MatchManager. \n\nOnce the match is set up, strap a Voice Remote for Amazon Echo to one of the player's arms. When they tell Alexa who wins a point, she announces it to the court and coordinates play of the match.\n\nNo wifi at the tennis club? Just use your phone as a hotspot. Need a battery for your Echo? Find them on Amazon. Stuck and need some help? More info up at www.TennisMatchManager.com.\n\nBasic things you can say to get started: \n “Start a match”\t\n“Register a new player”\nTo give a point to a player, say “point red”, or “point blue”.\n“Tell me more things I can say”\t\n\t\t\nExamples of more things you can say:\n“What's the score?”\n“Give me a summary of the match” (provides output to the Alexa app as well as verbal)\n“What's the set score?”\n“Who's serve is it?”\n“Tell me some shortcuts”\n“Tell me ways to change the match”\n\nExamples of ways that you can manually override and control the flow of the match:\n“Play with no add scoring”\n“Don't switch sides”\n“Change to blue team serve”\t\n“Change the set score”\n“Blue team won the game”\n“Start a new game”\n“Start a new set”\t\n If the score gets posted incorrectly, just say what the score should be. For example, say “30 All”\n\t\t\nExamples of combining information that will save time:\n“Start a doubles match with blue serve”\n“Add 206-867-5309 to the red team”\n“Register 425-867-5309”\n\nYou can always say “stop”, “cancel” or “exit”.",1,1,"B01BXCJA7C","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.4cd0a8f9-ba04-409f-8fd1-27b329e4e9e1","2016-02-18 16:24:05","keeper","Alexa, use keeper and start a singles match with red team's serve","give me some help","give me a summary of the match","http://tennismatchmanager.com/privacy.html","","No"

For example if the letter is F and the question prompt is ""a car manufacturer"" you could answer Ford. \n\nAt the end of the round, review each line of every player. If two or more players have the same answer, they are offset and no points are awarded. Answers can be challenged and ruled invalid by majority vote. For example, if the prompt was ""Television Show"" and the answer was ""Band of Brothers"", majority vote may argue it was an HBO miniseries and lose that point.\n\nYou can play winners per each game or round, or have multiple rounds and add the totals of all the round, say 3 rounds. \n\nYou may play with default or custom settings.

The skill will work with Wemo Switch, Wemo Insight Switch, and Wemo Light Switch, enabling ON/OFF voice commands from your Alexa-enabled devices.\n\nYou’ll need to use the Wemo app for iOS or Android to connect your Wemo switches to your home network and give them distinct names.  Open the Smart Home screen in the Alexa app, select “Get More Smart Home Skills”, select the WeMo skill and press “Enable Skill”.  The Alexa app will bring you to a page that will allow you to link your Alexa profile and your Wemo home.  For the Wemo authentication server to know what Wemo home to link, you need to establish the link on a mobile device or computer connected to the same network hosting your Wemo products (it’s ok if you’re connected through a 5GHz band and your Wemos are on the 2.4GHz band). In some network circumstances, you may be prompted to provide additional information about your network and your Wemos to ensure the right Wemo home is being linked to your Alexa profile.  The account linking portal will prompt you to turn one of your Wemos ON or OFF during a 2-minute window to verify the Wemo home.  It’s easiest to physically toggle any of your connected Wemo switches using the toggle button on the Wemo hardware.\n \nOnce your Wemo home is verified and linked to your Alexa profile, you can discover your devices by saying, “Alexa, discover my devices” or running a device discovery in the Smart Home screen of the Alexa app.\n \nTo control your devices, say “Alexa turn on/off my <device name>.”  You can also create groups of other ON/OFF devices in the Alexa app to control together.\n \nNow, you can control all the gadgets connected to your Wemo switches without having to reach for your phone or tablet.  Just give a shoutout (or a whisper), and Alexa will take care of it for you.

Don’t worry, you don’t need to change your due date or any settings; Alexa will do that for you! To understand how pregnancy tracking works, as well as what the Alexa skill can do, check out the Alexa article on the WhatToExpect.com homepage.\n \nWhat To Expect for Alexa guides you through pregnancy day-by-day and week-by-week. Just ask Alexa What To Expect every day, and you’ll get exciting updates about your pregnancy or newborn, plus all-new, useful tips to feel prepared and in control – helping you achieve a happy, healthy pregnancy.\n \nBased on the information that you provide, What To Expect uses your due date or your child’s birth date to provide personalized daily tips and updates. You can update this information at any time. What to Expect currently supports pregnancy and the first year after your baby’s birth. The What To Expect skill is complementary to your mobile app, so Daily Tips and Updates may be new or different from the mobile experience. For more information from fertility to your growing family (and all the milestones in between!) visit www.whattoexpect.com, or search for “What To Expect” in the App Store or Google Play.\n\nTo get started, enable the skill and tell Alexa your due date or child’s birth date. \n\nFor babies less than one year old you can ask:\n* Alexa, open What to Expect\n* Alexa, ask What to Expect for my daily tip\n* Alexa, ask What to Expect when was my baby born\n* Alexa, ask What to Expect to update my baby’s birth date to (month, day, and year)\n\nIf you are pregnant you can ask:\n* Alexa, open What to Expect\n*Alexa, ask What to Expect for my daily tip\n*Alexa, ask What to Expect for my pregnancy update\n*Alexa, tell What to Expect my baby has arrived\n* Alexa, ask What to Expect to update my due date to (month, day, and year)\n* Alexa,   ask What to Expect  when my baby is due",3.5,19,"B01JK91WBW","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.80a73d88-c2ac-4e6a-9eaa-c7c480d211fd","2016-09-30 16:42:37","what to expect","Alexa, open What to Expect","Alexa, ask What to Expect for my pregnancy update","Alexa, ask What to Expect for my daily tip","http://www.whattoexpect.com/privacy-policy","http://www.whattoexpect.com/terms-of-use","No"

"Wink",,"Wink","Say goodbye to fumbling for the light switch when you walk into the dark house with your arms full.

From there, getting started is easy:\n\n    1. Connect compatible products in your Wink app and set individual names for each lighting product (bedroom lamp, kitchen light, etc.). \n    2. Then, link your Wink account to Echo within the Echo mobile app (Settings > Connected Home > Device Links > Wink).\n    3. From there, say “Alexa, discover new devices.” This can take up to 20 seconds.\n\nYou can also adjust Wink-enabled Nest thermostats with Amazon Alexa either incrementally or to a specific temperature, making in-home climate control easier than ever. Put this Wink skill into action by saying, for example:\n\n    Alexa, increase bedroom by 3 degrees.\n\n    Alexa, set living room to 70 degrees.\n\nNote: as with lighting products, in order to use Amazon Alexa with Wink-enabled Nest Thermostats, you will need the Wink HUB. After a few simple steps, you’re ready to go:\n\n    1. If you haven’t already, first set up your Nest account and name each thermostat you have (living room, bedroom, kitchen, etc.).\n    2. Next, connect your Nest account with your Wink app. Your Nest Thermostat will appear in the Wink app as “[location] + [name] + [the word ‘thermostat’]. ""Home Living Room Thermostat,” for example.\n    3. Then, link your Wink account to Echo within the Alexa mobile app (Settings > Connected Home > Device Links > Wink). \n    4. Finally, say “Alexa, discover devices.” This can take up to 20 seconds. Your Nest Thermostat will then appear in the Alexa app as [name] i.e. “Living Room” or “Bedroom.”",4.3,85,"B01EIQYF3E","amzn1.ask.skill.013efdab-897c-4dff-9728-ac679242d818","2016-04-19 17:46:31",,"","","","http://www.wink.com/legal/","http://www.wink.com/legal/","No"
