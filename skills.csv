"1-Minute Mindfulness","null","GeekGirl Marketing and App Development","1-Minute Mindfulness from Walking Affirmations is a skill that allows you to take a break from the world around you and enter into a one minute sound meditation. Practicing mindfulness improves both mental and physical health. Mindfulness involves both concentration (a form of meditation) and acceptance. Many people struggle with how to begin meditating and get the rewards of a more contemplative life, so this skill is the perfect way to start a meditation practice. You can change your life, and change the world... one minute at a time. \n\nAs your meditation begins, remember all you have to do is focus on your breath. However this is harder than it seems. As your mind begins to wander, notice it, accept it lovingly and return your focus to your breathing. Its a little like training a puppy. As your mind thinks of other things, lovingly and gently return the focus to your breath. In time you will be able to stay present and focused for the full length of time. \n\nThere are several different meditations available. You can ask for a peaceful meditation or one with specific sounds. You can ask for a quick meditation or a forest meditation. You can also ask for a river meditation. Each of these one minute meditations will play a related meditative soundtrack to help you tune out the world and focus on your breath.\n\nHere are some examples of what you can say:\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a quick meditation""\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a 1 minute meditation""\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a minute meditation""\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a peaceful meditation""\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a river meditation""\n""Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a forest meditation""\n\nYou can also use the example phrases below as your guide.

The first is by city name. (The app does not currently understand airport names.) The second is by a three or four letter ICAO airport identifier. If you only provide three letters, the skill prepends a 'K' -- that is, it assumes you are referencing a US airport. You can specify any airport worldwide by providing all four letters. The letters must be provided using ICAO phonetics (alpha, bravo, charlie, etc.)\n\n\n\nThere are also a couple of experimental features you might try, but are not fully tested as yet:\n\n- Get the time in Zulu, like this:\n\n ""Alexa, ask airport weather to report zulu time""\n\n- set a default airport \n \nFirst, use the app, specifying an airport as usual.

"DC Metro Tracker","null","Sean Simpson","Get the most up to date Metro Rail information to stay on top of your Washington, DC commute! Optionally set a default home station to make retrieving Metro info even easier. \n\n============\n**NEW**\n============\nIntegration with www.ismetroonfire.com: Ask Alexa whether the metro is currently on fire! See below for details.\n\n============\nFEATURES:\n============\n* HOME STATION ~ Set a default home station simply by saying something like ""Alexa, ask Metro Tracker to set Metro Center as my home station."" Once you have set a home station, Metro Tracker will assume your departure station is your home station unless another departure station is specified. Change your home station at any time simply by re-using the ""set home station"" command. \n\n* LIST TRAINS ~ list all trains scheduled to arrive at a particular station. Try saying ""Alexa, ask Metro Tracker to list all trains arriving at Farragut West""\n\n* FILTER LINE ~ Tell Alexa which metro line you are interested in to only receive train times for that particular line. For example, try: ""Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for the next red line from Gallery Place.""\n\n* FILTER DIRECTIONS ~ Specify a destination to only get trains traveling in the direction you need. Try saying ""Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for the next train from Union Station to Dupont Circle.""\n\n* AVOID EARLY OFF-LOADING ~ Specifying a destination will return times only for trains going *at least* as far as you need. For example, asking for trains going from Union Station to Dupont Circle will *not* return times for trains only going as far as Farragut North.\n\n* COMMUTE TIMES ~ Get an estimate of how long it usually takes to travel between station A and station B. For example, try saying: ""Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for a commute estimate between L'Enfant Plaza and Columbia Heights,"" or ""Alexa, ask Metro Tracker how long it would take to get to Clarendon from Metro Center.""\n\n*ON FIRE? ~ Find out whether the metro is currently on fire! Just say something like ""Alexa, ask Metro Tracker if the metro is on fire,"" and Alexa will query www.ismetroonfire.com to give you the latest report. Hopefully most of the time the answer is no, but if smoke or fire has been reported on any metro lines, Alexa will let you know and tell you which lines are affected. \nShout out to Nick Stocchero, creator of ismetroonfire.com, for making this feature possible. Be sure to follow @ismetroonfire on Twitter to get tweet updates from his website!\n\n============\nBUGS:\n============\nIf you notice any bugs or problems with the app that should be fixed, or if there is a feature you would like to see added in the future, please send an email to dcmetrotracker@gmail.com\n\n============\nNOTES:\n============\n*Metro Tracker only relays information for trains that are at least one minute away. As such, trains that are currently boarding or arriving are not reported when you ask Metro Tracker for train times. This is done in order to make the output more concise, and only give you train times you can actually use (the vast majority of users do not live close enough to a metro station for info on trains currently boarding or arriving to be of use).\n\n*The transit info for Metro Tracker comes directly from the WMATA database that keeps track of all trains in the Metro system. This is generally highly reliable, but the recent safetrack initiative has resulted in some trains along affected routes being excluded from the database. Thus, it's possible there may be a train or two traveling the rails that Metro Tracker doesn't know about.\n\n*If at any time the app responds with ""there is a ghost train to a ghost station..."" this means that there is a train scheduled to arrive, but the WMATA database has no information on what line it belongs to, or where it is going. These are the trains that show up as ""--- --- TRAIN"" on the train arrival boards of metro platforms. Ghost trains sometimes have arrival times associated with them, and sometimes not.",3.6,4,"B01EYZBO38","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.48d300b5-e643-4150-aaff-f8d1b92ed568","2016-05-06 18:08:36","metro tracker","Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for the next orange line to Vienna from Metro Center","Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for delays on the red line","Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for a commute estimate between Metro Center and the airport","","","No"

Using HCA you can control, program, and schedule lights and appliances using many popular automation protocols. \n\nUnlike other home control systems, HCA is designed not to just control your home but also to program it. You don't need to accept the simple ""control a device"" using voice offered by some automation solutions. Using HCA you can create an automation solution that responds to your needs by combining multiple device in complex scenarios involving events, time, location, state of the home, etc. into one program. These programs express your intent of how your installation should work.\n\nIn addition to voice control, HCA offers clients for the iPad, iPhone, Android devices, and WIndows. With these client applications you are not locked into an application that displays as it wants to. You can create the page structure you see when interacting with the HCA client on your mobile device.  This can be configured on a device-by-device basis and on a user-by-user basis.  For some users, the display can show a complete set of pages for each room. For other users it can display a smaller set of only selected devices. For least technical users you can create a simple keypad like interface that offers only those actions you want to make available for them.\n\nIn one inclusive package HCA provides for creation and operation of simple to complex automation designs. \n\nThe top 20 feature list:\n\n1. Integrates Insteon, UPB, and other power line technologies\n2. Supports IP addressed IR interfaces\n3. Supports whole-house wireless\n4. Can be used in a client-server mode with multiple simultaneous read-write clients for complete local and remote access to design\n5. Amazon Alexa interaction\n6.

"Hunt the Yeti","null","James Church","Hunt the Yeti is an interpretation of the game Hunt The Wumpus (1972). In this game, you guide a hunter through a dark cave to discover the location of the yeti. Once you have helped the hunter locate the yeti, tell the hunter to throw the hunter's only spear in the direction of the yeti. If you are right about the location, you will help the hunter defeat the yeti! If not, the yeti will eventually find the hunter.\n\nIn this version of the game, the hunter is lost in a 5 by 5 cave. There are open pits, bats, and a single yeti. You hear the bats flutter, feel the breeze from the open pit, or smell the yeti near by. Bats will pick the hunter up and drop the hunter in a random (safe) location. If the hunter falls into a pit, the hunter dies and the game is over.

The game will guide you about where open rooms are, but it won't tell you what are in those rooms. It's up to you to use deductive reasoning to figure out where the Yeti and other traps are located.

With proper ear training, a musician is able to pick out melodies, chords, and entire songs completely by ear and away from their instruments.\n\nIntervalTrainer allows you to practice intervals randomly within the octave. You have a choice of ascending or descending intervals or both (by default) to practice your aural recognition skills. Practice ascending and descending interval ear training while you have a few minutes simply by saying ""give me an interval"", after that, Alexa will keep score for you and update you on your score as you go. \n\nTo ensure proper ear training and an un-biased key center, random starting notes are chosen. After each guess, feedback about your answer being right or not is given; and you're updated with your current score after a few attempts. Be sure to use the correct music interval terms: unison, minor second, major second, minor third, major third, perfect fourth, tritone, perfect fifth, minor sixth, major sixth, minor seventh, major seventh, and octave.\n\nAfter initializing IntervalTrainer with your first interval (""Alexa, as Interval Trainer to give me an interval""), reply back with that interval name (""perfect fourth""), and Alexa will confirm or reject your answer.\n\nTo switch interval directions, simply say ""switch interval direction to descending"" or ""switch interval direction to ascending"".\n\nYou can start over your scoring by saying ""reset score"" and you'll have a fresh scorecard.",5,2,"B01EMAVSP4","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.636a33b3-d9eb-4076-ac51-2769dac46135","2016-04-28 01:38:32","interval trainer","Alexa ask Interval Trainer to give me an interval","Alexa ask Interval Trainer for a descending interval","Alexa ask Interval Trainer","","","No"

After Alexa has guided you through the basic setup, you will get the next two trains that are on their way.\n\nYour first time using The L Train, you will be walked through setting up your first train stop, and the direction on the train you regularly travel. If this is your first time using The L Train, you can just ask the L train when its coming by saying ""Alexa, ask the L Train when it's coming"". Alexa will than ask you for the L train station you use the most.  Example stations are; Jefferson Street, 3rd Avenue or Lorimer Street. After your station is recognized, Alexa will ask you for what direction you regularly travel. Example directions are; Towards Manhattan, Towards Brooklyn, West, East, Canarsie or To Eight Ave. Once we have all your settings, whenever you ask The L Train when its coming, you will get precise times to help you schedule your departure. \n\nIf you would like to reset your settings, you can simply say ""Alexa, ask The L train to reset settings"".

"Morse Coder","null","Kay Lerch","This skill makes you an expert for Morse codes. You can explore three different features.\n\n1) Encode names to Morse code\n===============================\nIf you are interested in Morse codes expressing common US first names, go for something like:\n\n""Alexa, ask Morse Coder to encode <FirstName>"" \n\nwhere <FirstName> is any common first name of your choice.\n\nWith this intent Alexa plays back the corresponding Morse code. Moreover, this skill provides the Morse code to your Alexa App.\nDue to technical limitations by Amazon on audio tags this feature is only supported for names shorter than sixteen letters.\n \n2) Spell out names in Morse code\n===============================\nSimilar to the encode feature of Morse Coder this feature lets Alexa spell out a common US first name of your choice in Morse code. \nThe spell-out feature is designed for newcomers who want to learn Morse code letter by letter. Try out:\n\n""Alexa, spell out <FirstName>"" \n\nwhere <FirstName> is any common US first name of your choice. Once again Alexa even returns the Morse code to your Alexa App.\nDue to technical limitations by Amazon on audio tags this feature is only supported for names shorter than six letters.\n\n3) Exercises / Learn Morse Code\n===============================\nAs soon as you got the basics on Morse codes you can test your comprehension. Start an exercise by saying:\n\n""Alexa, start exercise""\n\nand Alexa starts playing a Morse code and asks you to decode and pronounce the word being played. If Alexa doesn't get what you're saying, try to spell the correct answer.\nIf you are not sure Alexa tries to help you by slowing down the playback speed of the code as soon as you give a wrong answer or wait for several seconds without giving an answer. \nAnother option to simplify things for you is to look in your Alexa App. There you can find the written Morse code along with a spelled version of it (""Di-dah-dit ..."").\nActually the Alexa App is the best resource for you while exercising as you can learn a lot from the cards provided by the Morse Coder.\nOptionally you can skip or cancel an exercise by saying ""Next"" or ""Cancel"". If you need help free to ask for ""Help"" at any time. If you want to listen to a code again, just ask Alexa to ""Repeat"". \nYou can interrupt an exercise at any time by using one of the above features (""Spell out <FirstName>"", ""Encode <FirstName>"") and get back to the exercise just by expressing your guess to last played code. Also ""Repeat"" brings you back to the exercise.\nThe capability of switching between an exercise and the other features helps you researching for the correct answer. \n\nScoring\nFor each word you decode correctly you get points which sum up in your personal score. The score persists throughout one session. \nAlexa starts with asking you to decode a randomly picked word with five letters. \nIf you guess the word, Alexa increases the length of the next word. Otherwise Alexa decreases the length to make things easier for you. \nWords in Morse Coder have a minimum length of three characters and a maximum length of eight characters. \nThe longer a word the more points you get out of an answer. Wrong answers on the other hand could degrade your score. \n\nIf you are switching between the features your score persists and doesn't get lost.\n\n4) General features\n===============================\n""Repeat"" during an exercise plays back a code again in a slower version. It also is an option to get back to your exercise if you switched to the spell-out or encode feature.\n""Next"" or ""Start over"" at any time should guide you to the next random code. The current exercise will be skipped.\n""Stop"" quits the skill and stops the exercise. You are provided with your final score.\n""Help"" gives some information on what to say.\n""Cancel"" stops the current exercise. Alexa will give you the correct word for the current code and asks you to continue with another code.",3.9,6,"B01G4F0B4O","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.c26b1c82-967e-4807-b1c2-e983e820edf1","2016-05-26 06:08:35","morse coder","Alexa, tell morse coder to teach me","Alexa, ask morse coder to encode Michael","Alexa, ask morse coder to spell out the name James","","","No"

If Alexa can locate the actual audio snippet of the author of the quote on YouTube, she will even play the original sound bite for you instead of reading it.  \n\nDesigned for entrepreneurs, software developers, business professionals, or people who need a little inspiration to start their day.  So get motivated and make today the day your dreams come true!  \n\nWe have also designed a t-shirt, poster, and canvas for every inspirational quote you hear which you can purchase on our website http://sexyhackers.com to support the development of this skill.   You can view a preview of the t-shirt design or poster containing the quote she just read in the Alexa Companion App.  \n\nDISCLAIMER :  SexyHackers.com does NOT contain any nudity and is work safe.  It's just a fun website which sells t-shirts, posters, and hats containing motivational quotes.   However, some of these famous quotes may not be suitable for all ages as they may contain adult language.  We feature quotes from business leaders like Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Steve Jobs, Aaron Levie,  Haward Schutz, Blake Mycoskie, Dennis Crowley, Mark Zuckerberg and much more! \n\nWANT US TO ADD A QUOTE: \nIf there is a particular quote you would like us to add send us the information on Twitter @MoreThanRewards and we'll do our best to add it!\n\nHAVING TROUBLE WITH THIS SKILL: The only item we're aware of is if you have more than one echo device, you might need to disable and re-enable the skill again if you add a new echo to your account. This is normal since everything has to resync to the new devices.  So if you're having trouble just disable and re-enable the skill then try again by saying 'Alexa, Motivate Me', all will be good.   \n\nThe other obvious item is some folks have changed their device name to Amazon or Echo, as a reminder, if you do that then you'll need to say 'Amazon Motivate Me' or 'Echo Motivate Me' depending on what you call your echo.   We had one person who didn't realize this and claim the skill didn't work on our review but the problem was they didn't invoke it with the correct echo name.  So before you post a review if you could give us a chance to help you we would love to help you since we have no way to actually contact people who write reviews if they don't contact us. \n\nYou can call our customer support line at 414-326-4100 or email support@morethanrewards.com or do live chat with u s on our website SexyHackers.com, we're open Monday to Friday 8AM to 5PM Central Time. \n\nWe want to make Alexa awesome so if you have any ideas on how to improve this skill just let us know. \n\nTHANK YOU! \nThe SexyHacker.com Team",3,2,"B01G6LOP9S","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.3ecfceda-950d-4673-82f6-25d038344f68","2016-06-06 08:38:32","motivate me","Alexa, motivate me","Alexa, tell motivate me to give me a quote","Alexa, ask motivate me for an inspiring quote","http://www.morethanrewards.com/privacy.htm","http://www.morethanrewards.com/terms-and-conditions.htm","No"

"PingPong Showdown","null","Dana Young","Got a ping pong table? Let Alexa keep score and make the game even more fun with her wisecracks. This is a full featured skill with more than 25 interactions. Alexa is a great score keeper, but lookout for her sharp humor! She has a sass-meter, so you can adjust it from 0 (off) to 10 (full up). She never forgets the score or when to switch serving. In fact every point and every game you play is stored for bragging rights against rivals. \n\nYou can play both singles and doubles matches. You can sign in so that all match stats are stored for you, or skip sign-in and just play. In addition to the game and match scores, you can also hear what percent of  games and individual points were won/lost vs that opponent, what your win percentage was when serving, and what your longest point streak of the match was.\n\nTo get started, first register by saying 'register a new player'. Then just say, 'Use ping pong and start a match'. Whether it is singles or doubles, you will have a red team and a blue team. Once you've started a match, the only thing to do is tell Alexa who wins a point. Do that by saying 'point blue', or 'point red'. All the rest is coordinated by Alexa. \n\nWhen doing the one-time registration, you will choose a 4-digit number for your player ID and tell Alexa your first name. Then when starting a match, Alexa will prompt players for their IDs and kick off the match.\n\n\nBasic things you can say to get started: \n “Start a match”\n “Start a doubles match”\n “Set the sass-meter to zero.” (0-10)\t\n “Tell me the rules of ping pong”\n“Register a new player”\n “Undo that”\t\nTo give a point to a player, say “Point Red”, or “Point Blue”.\n“Tell me more things I can say”\t\n\t\t\nExamples of more things you can say:\n“What's the score?”\n“Give me a summary of the match” (provides output to the Alexa app as well as verbal)\n“What's the match score?”\n“Who's serve is it?”\n“Tell me how to set preferences”\n“Tell me ways to change the match”\n\nExamples of ways that you can manually override and control the flow of the match:\n“Play games to 21” (or 11)\n“Play best three out of five”\n“Play best three out of five” \n“Play a single game match”  \n“Change the number of serves per turn” (to either 2 or 5)\n“Don't switch sides”\t\n“Change the score”\n“Start a new game”\n\nHere are ways that you can set preferences for what Alexa says during the match:\n“Keep it short” This cuts down on the things Alexa says.\n“Don't switch sides”\n\nYou can save and load your match preferences. Preferences include:\n- Playing to either 11 or 21 points in a game\n- Playing matches with either one game, or best three out of five games\n- Setting of the sass-meter between 0-10\n- Switching sides after serve (on/off)\n- Experienced user mode, where comments are kept short\n\nWhen you say, Save Preferences, the settings of the current match will be stored in your profile. \nTo load your preferences, say, Load Preferences after starting a new match.\n\nYou can always say “stop”, “cancel” or “exit”.",0,0,"B01ESOHSLC","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.8cbbec55-1a6a-4eaf-b2f8-c898f8a6be37","2016-07-01 05:57:53","ping pong","Alexa, use pingpong and start a match","what are my options?","register a new player","http://pingpong-showdown.appspot.com/privacy.html","","No"

We GUARANTEE he'll play you only unique quotes until you've listened to ALL of them. We've also worked hard to make sure Alexa reads the quotes as naturally, and as close to way the original crew member said them, as possible.\n\nAt Majel Tech, we pride ourselves on our best-in-class language recognition.

We think you'll be pleased.\n\nNote: that being said, we're not perfect! If Alexa starts her response with ""A quote from <crew member>"", that means she believes you requested a quote from a random crew member. If you had actually requested a quote from someone in particular, she misheard you (you can always look at the card in the Alexa app to see for sure which crew member the quote is from).

"Tennis MatchManager","null","Dana Young","Pros play tennis with a human umpire that coordinates flow of the match and keeps score. They get access to detailed stats to analyze and improve their game. Over years, this data provides insights into their own personal game as well as how best to compete or partner with others. \n\nWith Alexa, you can get this kind of experience at the college, club and recreational player level. Every point you play is stored so you can review statistics and trends to improve your game. \n\nTennis MatchManager coordinates both singles and doubles matches. You can sign in so that all match stats are stored for you long term, or skip sign in and just play. Even skipping sign in will allow you to review all the data about that particular match. In addition to the set and match scores, you can also hear how long you played, what percent of  games and individual points were won/lost vs that opponent, and what your win percentage was when serving.\n\nTo get started, just say 'start a match'.  If you would like to have MatchManager keep track of your match data long term, first register by saying 'register a new player'. Registered players can be added to the match by saying 'add a player'. Whether it is singles or doubles, you will have a red team and a blue team. Once you've started a match, the only  thing to do is tell Alexa who wins a point. Do that by saying 'point blue', or 'point red'. All the rest is coordinated and stored by MatchManager. \n\nOnce the match is set up, strap a Voice Remote for Amazon Echo to one of the player's arms. When they tell Alexa who wins a point, she announces it to the court and coordinates play of the match.\n\nNo wifi at the tennis club? Just use your phone as a hotspot. Need a battery for your Echo? Find them on Amazon. Stuck and need some help? More info up at www.TennisMatchManager.com.\n\nBasic things you can say to get started: \n “Start a match”\t\n“Register a new player”\nTo give a point to a player, say “point red”, or “point blue”.\n“Tell me more things I can say”\t\n\t\t\nExamples of more things you can say:\n“What's the score?”\n“Give me a summary of the match” (provides output to the Alexa app as well as verbal)\n“What's the set score?”\n“Who's serve is it?”\n“Tell me some shortcuts”\n“Tell me ways to change the match”\n\nExamples of ways that you can manually override and control the flow of the match:\n“Play with no add scoring”\n“Don't switch sides”\n“Change to blue team serve”\t\n“Change the set score”\n“Blue team won the game”\n“Start a new game”\n“Start a new set”\t\n If the score gets posted incorrectly, just say what the score should be. For example, say “30 All”\n\t\t\nExamples of combining information that will save time:\n“Start a doubles match with blue serve”\n“Add 206-867-5309 to the red team”\n“Register 425-867-5309”\n\nYou can always say “stop”, “cancel” or “exit”.",1,1,"B01BXCJA7C","amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.4cd0a8f9-ba04-409f-8fd1-27b329e4e9e1","2016-02-18 16:24:05","keeper","Alexa, use keeper and start a singles match with red team's serve","give me some help","give me a summary of the match","http://tennismatchmanager.com/privacy.html","","No"

When the round begins a random letter will be chosen, the following questions must be answered using a word that begins with that letter. For example if the letter is F and the question prompt is ""a car manufacturer"" you could answer Ford. \n\nAt the end of the round, review each line of every player. If two or more players have the same answer, they are offset and no points are awarded. Answers can be challenged and ruled invalid by majority vote. For example, if the prompt was ""Television Show"" and the answer was ""Band of Brothers"", majority vote may argue it was an HBO miniseries and lose that point.\n\nYou can play winners per each game or round, or have multiple rounds and add the totals of all the round, say 3 rounds. \n\nYou may play with default or custom settings.

"Wink","null","Wink","Say goodbye to fumbling for the light switch when you walk into the dark house with your arms full. Amazon Alexa makes it easier than ever to adjust your Wink-compatible lighting products.  You can use the Wink skill to either turn the lights on/off by saying, for example: \n\n    Alexa, turn on downstairs lamp.\n\nOr dim the lights to a desired setting: \n\n    Alexa, set living room light to 50%.\n\nNote: in order to use Amazon Alexa with Wink-compatible lighting products, you will need the Wink HUB. From there, getting started is easy:\n\n    1. Connect compatible products in your Wink app and set individual names for each lighting product (bedroom lamp, kitchen light, etc.). \n    2. Then, link your Wink account to Echo within the Echo mobile app (Settings > Connected Home > Device Links > Wink).\n    3. From there, say “Alexa, discover new devices.” This can take up to 20 seconds.\n\nYou can also adjust Wink-enabled Nest thermostats with Amazon Alexa either incrementally or to a specific temperature, making in-home climate control easier than ever. Put this Wink skill into action by saying, for example:\n\n    Alexa, increase bedroom by 3 degrees.\n\n    Alexa, set living room to 70 degrees.\n\nNote: as with lighting products, in order to use Amazon Alexa with Wink-enabled Nest Thermostats, you will need the Wink HUB. After a few simple steps, you’re ready to go:\n\n    1. If you haven’t already, first set up your Nest account and name each thermostat you have (living room, bedroom, kitchen, etc.).\n    2. Next, connect your Nest account with your Wink app. Your Nest Thermostat will appear in the Wink app as “[location] + [name] + [the word ‘thermostat’]. ""Home Living Room Thermostat,” for example.\n    3. Then, link your Wink account to Echo within the Alexa mobile app (Settings > Connected Home > Device Links > Wink). \n    4. Finally, say “Alexa, discover devices.” This can take up to 20 seconds. Your Nest Thermostat will then appear in the Alexa app as [name] i.e. “Living Room” or “Bedroom.”",4.3,55,"B01EIQYF3E","amzn1.ask.skill.013efdab-897c-4dff-9728-ac679242d818","2016-04-19 17:46:31","null","","","","http://www.wink.com/legal/","http://www.wink.com/legal/","No"
