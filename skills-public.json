      "description": "1-Minute Mindfulness from Walking Affirmations is a skill that allows you to take a break from the world around you and enter into a one minute sound meditation. Practicing mindfulness improves both mental and physical health. Mindfulness involves both concentration (a form of meditation) and acceptance. Many people struggle with how to begin meditating and get the rewards of a more contemplative life, so this skill is the perfect way to start a meditation practice. You can change your life, and change the world... one minute at a time. \n\nAs your meditation begins, remember all you have to do is focus on your breath. However this is harder than it seems. As your mind begins to wander, notice it, accept it lovingly and return your focus to your breathing. Its a little like training a puppy. As your mind thinks of other things, lovingly and gently return the focus to your breath. In time you will be able to stay present and focused for the full length of time. \n\nThere are several different meditations available. You can ask for a peaceful meditation or one with specific sounds. You can ask for a quick meditation or a forest meditation. You can also ask for a river meditation. Each of these one minute meditations will play a related meditative soundtrack to help you tune out the world and focus on your breath.\n\nHere are some examples of what you can say:\n\"Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a quick meditation\"\n\"Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a 1 minute meditation\"\n\"Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a minute meditation\"\n\"Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a peaceful meditation\"\n\"Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a river meditation\"\n\"Alexa Open Mindfulness and Ask for a forest meditation\"\n\nYou can also use the example phrases below as your guide.

      "description": "Update: 3/27:\nThank you for the feedback! I added the ability to ask for the last time a stat was tracked (make sure to ask baby stats to set timezone otherwise it will not be able to tell you the exact time only how long ago it occurred),\nExamples:\nAlexa ask baby stats when was the last {stool, wet, feeding}\nAlexa ask baby stats for the last diaper\nAlexa ask baby stats what time was the last pee\n\nOur first baby boy is about to be born! No I don't mean this skill, I mean an actual baby! In our pre-natal classes we were told that doctors required you to track certain statistics for your baby for each day when it's an infant. We talked about putting a pen and paper by the changing station, but realized that it would be really easy if there was a Alexa skill that could do this. This skill is designed to do just what it says. Track stats for your baby, and be able to repeat them back to you. \n\nJust say:\nAlexa, ask baby stats to add stool\nAlexa, ask baby stats to add wet,\nAlexa, ask baby stats to add meal.\n\nWe've added as many words as we could think of to signify \"stool\" or \"wet\". Other examples are poop, pee etc... Try to see if you can find the extra easter egg ones :). Baby stats will count the stats against the current day. Once midnight rolls around everything will be tracked against the next day etc and onward.\n\nYou can also ask Alexa to remove or delete stool, wet or meal as well.\n\nExample:\nAlexa, ask baby stats to remove meal.\n\nAs you tally up the stats each day you can go back and ask Alexa to \"get\" those stats and repeat them back to you.\nAlexa, ask baby stats when was the last poop\nAlexa, ask baby stats when was the last pee\nAlexa, ask baby stats what time was the last feeding\nAlexa, ask baby stats to get stats for February 27\nAlexa, ask baby stats to get stats for last Monday.\nAlexa, ask baby stats to get stats for this week\n\nLastly, don't forget to say \"Alexa, ask baby stats to set timezone\" {pacific, eastern, or central} so that it counts the whole day. It currently defaults to pacific time, so otherwise it may switch over to a new day 3 hours late.\n\nHappy baby tracking!\n\nFull list of examples to say to baby stats:\nAlexa, ask baby stats to add stool\nAlexa ask baby stats to add poo\nAlexa, ask baby stats to add wet,\nAlexa ask baby stats to add pee\nAlexa, ask baby stats to add meal.\nAlexa, ask baby stats to remove stool.\nAlexa, ask baby stats to delete wet.\nAlexa ask baby stats to remove wet\nAlexa, ask baby stats to decrement meal.\nAlexa, ask baby stats when was the last poop\nAlexa, ask baby stats when was the last pee\nAlexa, ask baby stats what time was the last feeding\nAlexa, ask baby stats to get stats for February 27\nAlexa, ask baby stats to get stats for today\nAlexa, ask baby stats to get stats for this week\nAlexa ask baby stats when was the last {stool, wet, feeding,poop,pee etc..}\nAlexa ask baby stats for the last diaper",

Or, you can ask Alexa for your order’s status with Domino’s Tracker®.\n\nTo place an order with Alexa, you’ll need a Domino’s Pizza Profile. If you don’t have a Pizza Profile, set one up at www.dominos.com. You’ll also need an Easy Order or a recent order saved within your Pizza Profile. Once you’ve placed your order, you can ask Alexa for Domino’s Tracker® updates at each stage, from the time it’s placed to when it’s ready for delivery or pickup. Alexa will simply use the phone number saved in your Pizza Profile.\nIf you just want to track your carryout or delivery order from Domino’s, enter the phone number you used with a recent order into the app. Alexa will give you the current status of your order whenever you ask.\n\nTo get started, just say “Alexa, open Domino’s.” Alexa will connect you to Domino’s and get you ordering and tracking in no time.\n\nLearn more about Echo ordering and all the newest ways to order Domino’s at http://anyware.dominos.com/.",

The setting takes place after a World War III project to create artificial intelligence went rogue under the influence of an extraterrestrial entity known as the \"Exsurgent\" (best described as an organic computer virus with the capacity to infect both machines and animals with sapient qualities), resulting in the deaths of over 90% of the inhabitants of Earth.\n\nEarth is subsequently abandoned, and existing colonies throughout the Solar System are expanded to accommodate the refugees. The setting explores a spectrum of socioeconomic systems in each of these colonies:\n\n- A capitalist/republican system continues in the Inner System (Mars, the Moon, and Mercury), under the Planetary Consortium, a corporate body which allows the election of representatives but whose shareholders are nominally most powerful.\n- An Extropian/Propertarian system is established in the Asteroid Belt.\n- A military oligarchy rules the moons around Jupiter.\n- An alliance of Scandinavia-style social democracy and Collectivist anarchism are dominant in the Outer System.\n\nFrom there, the setting explores various scientific advances, extrapolated far into the future. Nanotechnology, terraforming, Zero-G living, upgrading animal sapience, and reputation systems are all used as plot points and background.\n\nWith all of this, the game encourages players to confront existential threats like aliens, weapons of mass destruction, Exsurgent Virus outbreaks, and political unrest.\n\nData for this Skill has been sourced from Eclipse Phase materials under the Creative Commons License (http://eclipsephase.com/cclicense)\n\nPlease support this game and its fans by visiting, http://eclipsephase.com.

Once your account is created, you need to have at least one authorized ISY in your account. For more information on setting up your ISY on portal: http://www.universal-devices.com/install-module/\nWhen you enable this skill, you will be prompted to link your echo to your UDI portal account. You will have to provide your UDI portal user ID and password. Once the link process is complete, you can start using the skill.\nIf your portal account has several ISYs, you need to start by choosing which ISY you want to control. You can login to portal, go to your profile, and select your preferred ISY. Alternatively, you can say to your echo: \"Alexa, tell izzy to select my preferred I.S.Y.\", and you will be prompted to say which ISY you want to control. You need to say the Alias you assigned to your ISY in portal. If your account has only one ISY, this step is not required.\n\nBefore you can control devices, you also need to configure them in portal at https://my.isy.io. Go to the ISY tab, and use the tool \"Amazon Echo\" on your ISY.\n\nHere's the complete capability list:\nTurn off a device\nTurn on a device\nTurn on a device to x percent\nBrighten device\nDim device\nToggle device\nGet device status\nLock a door\nUnlock a door\nLock all doors (Alexa will lock all devices it recognizes as a lock)\nUnlock all doors\nGet thermostat temperature\nGet/Set thermostat mode\nGet/Set thermostat setpoint for heat or cool\nIncrease/Decrease setpoint\nRun program (runIf only)\nStop program\nGet program status",

In this way, Alexa could be described as an \"Answering Machine.\" \n\nJim Rockford's bulking answering machine represented an automation technology that television viewers in 1974 hadn't considered to be accessible to the private individual. The subtle irony was that this fantastic machine's potential was being squandered with having to accurately dictate the ridiculous ramblings of Angel and Rockford's other colorful associates.\n\nWith the \"Jim Rockford Answering Machine\" Alexa skill, you can likewise squander the magnificent potential of your \"Answering Machine\" by conscripting Alexa to read transcriptions from it's ancestor on Jim Rockford's desk. \n\nTo use, just say, \"Ask Jim Rockford's Answering Machine to read a message.\"",

      "description": "Ask Alexa when the next train is coming to your NYC MTA L train stop, and listen to the current L train status. This app is simply for asking Alexa when the next L train is coming in a particular direction. For example, if you commute to work or school from Brooklyn to Manhattan everyday, Alexa will always be prepared to tell you when the next train is coming, and if there is any service changes you need to know about. After Alexa has guided you through the basic setup, you will get the next two trains that are on their way.\n\nYour first time using The L Train, you will be walked through setting up your first train stop, and the direction on the train you regularly travel. If this is your first time using The L Train, you can just ask the L train when its coming by saying \"Alexa, ask the L Train when it's coming\". Alexa will than ask you for the L train station you use the most.  Example stations are; Jefferson Street, 3rd Avenue or Lorimer Street. After your station is recognized, Alexa will ask you for what direction you regularly travel. Example directions are; Towards Manhattan, Towards Brooklyn, West, East, Canarsie or To Eight Ave. Once we have all your settings, whenever you ask The L Train when its coming, you will get precise times to help you schedule your departure. \n\nIf you would like to reset your settings, you can simply say \"Alexa, ask The L train to reset settings\". This will walk you through the startup process. If you fail to complete the startup process, you will be prompted to complete it on next use.\n\nOnce you are all setup, you can always just say \"Alexa ask the L Train\" or \"Alexa open the L Train\", or even \"Alexa run the L Train\" to get your train times in the fastest way possible. But you an always use more complete phrasing like, \"Alexa, ask the L Train when it's coming?\".\n\nThis skill works for every L train stop in New York City, including Brooklyn and Queens.",

In order to use this service you need a Nest thermostat, Nest account, and a Reflect Connect account.\n\nReflect Connect allows you full control over your Nest thermostats. You can:\n1.\tGet the temperature setting by saying something like, “Alexa,  ask Reflect what Nest is set to” or “Alexa, ask Reflect what they Entryway temperature setting is.”\n2.\tGet the current temperature reading by saying something like, “Alexa,  ask Reflect what the temperature is” or “Alexa, ask Reflect what they Entryway temperature is.”\n3.\tGet the current Humidity reading by saying something like, “Alexa,  ask Reflect what the humidity is” or “Alexa, ask Reflect what they Entryway humidity is.”\n4.\tGet the current humidity, temperature, and temperature setting by saying something like, “Alexa, ask Reflect to give me the thermostat information,” or “Alexa, ask Reflect to give me the basement information.” (Note: this request will keep the stream open to allow you to adjust temperature settings.)\n5.\tChange the temperature setting by saying something like, “Alexa, ask Reflect to change the temperature to seventy degrees,” or “Alexa, ask Reflect to change the entryway temperature to sixty-eight.”\n6.\tChange the temperature in heat-cool mode by saying something like, “Alexa, ask Reflect to set the temperature from sixty-eight to seventy-three” or “Alexa, ask reflect to set the kids room temperature between sixty-nine and seventy-four” (Note: for now you can not reference just the heat to or just the cool to temperature. We are planning on adding this in a future update.)\n\nNote: If the name of the device is not specified, Reflect will use the default device that has been chosen at www.reflectconnectapp.com. Additionally custom thermostat names are not supported. In order for you to control a specific device it needs to have one of the following default Nest thermostat names : Bedroom, dining room, entryway, hallway, kitchen, den, basement, downstairs, family room, kids room, living room, master bedroom, office, upstairs.\n\nFor more information regarding the use of this skill as well as troubleshooting step for setting the skill up please visit www.reflectconnectapp.com/support.

Use this skill for pure entertainment value, or use the random quote feature to turn it into a drinking game.\n\nAsk Roddenberry for a quote to hear one of a curated selection of the best crew quotes.\n\nExamples of things you can do are: ask Roddenberry to give you a quote from any senior TNG crew member, ask him to surprise you, or ask him to repeat the previous quote.\n\nUnlike Alexa experiences that use simplistic random algorithms, annoyingly repeating the same responses over and over while there's still more to hear, Roddenberry won't repeat any quotes until you've heard them all. We GUARANTEE he'll play you only unique quotes until you've listened to ALL of them. We've also worked hard to make sure Alexa reads the quotes as naturally, and as close to way the original crew member said them, as possible.\n\nAt Majel Tech, we pride ourselves on our best-in-class language recognition. We've spent a lot of time at thinking up anything you might naturally say in requesting Roddenberry's functionality. Go ahead, try it! We think you'll be pleased.\n\nNote: that being said, we're not perfect! If Alexa starts her response with \"A quote from <crew member>\", that means she believes you requested a quote from a random crew member. If you had actually requested a quote from someone in particular, she misheard you (you can always look at the card in the Alexa app to see for sure which crew member the quote is from). Please try again, and if it doesn't work, let us know! We want to continually improve our language recognition, and your feedback helps us do that!

      "description": "Pros play tennis with a human umpire that coordinates flow of the match and keeps score. They get access to detailed stats to analyze and improve their game. Over years, this data provides insights into their own personal game as well as how best to compete or partner with others. \n\nWith Alexa, you can get this kind of experience at the college, club and recreational player level. Every point you play is stored so you can review statistics and trends to improve your game. \n\nTennis MatchManager coordinates both singles and doubles matches. You can sign in so that all match stats are stored for you long term, or skip sign in and just play. Even skipping sign in will allow you to review all the data about that particular match. In addition to the set and match scores, you can also hear how long you played, what percent of  games and individual points were won/lost vs that opponent, and what your win percentage was when serving.\n\nTo get started, just say 'start a match'.  If you would like to have MatchManager keep track of your match data long term, first register by saying 'register a new player'. Registered players can be added to the match by saying 'add a player'. Whether it is singles or doubles, you will have a red team and a blue team. Once you've started a match, the only  thing to do is tell Alexa who wins a point. Do that by saying 'point blue', or 'point red'. All the rest is coordinated and stored by MatchManager. \n\nOnce the match is set up, strap a Voice Remote for Amazon Echo to one of the player's arms. When they tell Alexa who wins a point, she announces it to the court and coordinates play of the match.\n\nNo wifi at the tennis club? Just use your phone as a hotspot. Need a battery for your Echo? Find them on Amazon. Stuck and need some help? More info up at www.TennisMatchManager.com.\n\nBasic things you can say to get started: \n “Start a match”\t\n“Register a new player”\nTo give a point to a player, say “point red”, or “point blue”.\n“Tell me more things I can say”\t\n\t\t\nExamples of more things you can say:\n“What's the score?”\n“Give me a summary of the match” (provides output to the Alexa app as well as verbal)\n“What's the set score?”\n“Who's serve is it?”\n“Tell me some shortcuts”\n“Tell me ways to change the match”\n\nExamples of ways that you can manually override and control the flow of the match:\n“Play with no add scoring”\n“Don't switch sides”\n“Change to blue team serve”\t\n“Change the set score”\n“Blue team won the game”\n“Start a new game”\n“Start a new set”\t\n If the score gets posted incorrectly, just say what the score should be. For example, say “30 All”\n\t\t\nExamples of combining information that will save time:\n“Start a doubles match with blue serve”\n“Add 206-867-5309 to the red team”\n“Register 425-867-5309”\n\nYou can always say “stop”, “cancel” or “exit”.",

The article was an attempt to demystify the behavior of the program, and included a detailed description of the program. ELIZA is based on a \"script\" consisting of patterns and corresponding responses. An appendix to the article contained the complete script for the Rogerian psychologist. I used the same script.\n\nThanks to Charles Hayden for the Java code that I modified for my use. \n\nhttp://www.chayden.net/Index.shtml",

When the round begins a random letter will be chosen, the following questions must be answered using a word that begins with that letter. For example if the letter is F and the question prompt is \"a car manufacturer\" you could answer Ford. \n\nAt the end of the round, review each line of every player. If two or more players have the same answer, they are offset and no points are awarded. Answers can be challenged and ruled invalid by majority vote. For example, if the prompt was \"Television Show\" and the answer was \"Band of Brothers\", majority vote may argue it was an HBO miniseries and lose that point.\n\nYou can play winners per each game or round, or have multiple rounds and add the totals of all the round, say 3 rounds. \n\nYou may play with default or custom settings. Default consists of 10 questions with 10 seconds between each question.

This can allow someone to very easily build a proof of concept around voice interaction on Echo with their service before implementing their own service with Alexa Skillsets. For example, on portal.theubi.com, someone can setup a rule that if someone says on their Echo \"jump\" the response back to the Echo will be \"How high\". Phrases spoken into the Echo can trigger multiple actions. \"Alexa, Open Portal\" or \"Alexa, ask portal (question)\" or \"Alexa, tell portal (something)\" will send the request to Ubi Cloud to check for a user created rules.
