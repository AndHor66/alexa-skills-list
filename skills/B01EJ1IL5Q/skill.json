  "description": "The Wheel of the Year is an annual cycle of seasonal festivals, observed by many modern Pagans. It consists of either four or eight festivals: either the solstices and equinoxes, known as the \"quarter days\", or the four midpoints between, known as the \"cross quarter days\"; syncretic traditions like Wicca often celebrate all eight festivals.\n\nThis skill brings you information on all eight Sabbats. The Sabbats are Samhain, Yule, Imbolc, Ostara, Beltane, Litha, Lammas, and Mabon.\n\nYou can also ask for the following correspondences: colors, foods, herbs, stones, and symbols.",
