  "description": "Need a lift? With the Lyft skill for Alexa, you can request a ride and get picked up in minutes from the home address set in your Lyft account. If you've set a work address, your weekday commute can be a breeze, too. Instead of hailing a cab or waiting for the bus, just request a car with your voice. Lyft is cheaper than a taxi, faster than the bus, and easy to use.\n \nTo get started, enable the skill and link a Lyft account. Then just ask\n\n    - \"Alexa, ask Lyft to call a line to work for 2 people.\"\n    - \"Alexa, ask Lyft where my ride is\"\n    - \"Alexa, tell Lyft to rate my driver 3 stars.\"\n    - \"Alexa, ask Lyft how long getting a line to work will take.\"\n\nLyft for Alexa uses the Work and Home addresses you've specified inside your Lyft App. Lyft for Alexa will always send a car to your Lyft 'Home' address.\n \nNew to Lyft?
