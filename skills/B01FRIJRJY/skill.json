  "description": "With the Venstar skill and Alexa, you can now interact with your Venstar thermostats by voice. To get started, select the ‘Enable Skill’ button in the Alexa App to link your Skyport account and discover your thermostat(s). Find more information about connecting Smart Home devices at http://amzn.to/291lR7u.\n\nWhen using the skill, you need to specify by name which thermostat/sensor to use. There are two ways to define this/these name(s):\n* Use the name(s) you set up already – these are shown in the Venstar app and can be changed, or\n* Create an Alexa group, like Bedroom or Downstairs, and add the thermostat and/or one or more sensors to the group. More information is available at http://amzn.to/2965dCE.\n\nOnce you know the name or group of your thermostat, you can say the following: “Alexa, lower Bedroom by 3 degrees”, or “Alexa, set Downstairs temperature to 72”.\n\nIf you have any questions, please visit the Venstar Alexa FAQ at http://venstar.com/smart/alexa/ .",
