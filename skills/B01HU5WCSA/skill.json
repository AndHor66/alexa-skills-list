Find more information about connecting Smart Home devices at http://amzn.to/291lR7u\nWhen using the skill, you need to specify by name which device to use. There are two ways to define this/these names:\n• Use the name(s) you set up already – these are the rooms shown in the Stack Lighting app and can be changed, or\n• Create an Alexa group, like Bedroom or Downstairs, and add the device to the group. More information at http://amzn.to/2965dCE\n\nOnce you know the name or group of your device(s), you can say the following: \n* “Alexa, turn on my Bedroom lights”.\n* “Alexa, brighten Downstairs to 60 percent\", or \"Alexa, dim the Living Room lights\".\n\nIf you have any questions, please visit the Stack Lighting support page at support.stacklighting.com.",
