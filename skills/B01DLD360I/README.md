To use the Chicago Trains skill, try saying...

* *Alexa ask Chicago Trains when is the next train from Crystal Lake to Downtown*

* *Alexa ask Chicago Trains for the next train from Chicago to Naperville express only*

* *Alex, ask Chicago Trains for the train schedule from Naperville to Union Station*

Never miss your train again.

Chicago Trains lets you find the next train leaving a particular station that stops at your desired destination.  It will also let you hear the train schedule for the rest of the day for a particular starting station and destination station.    Here are some example phrases:

Next Train Example:
When is the next train from Crystal Lake to Downtown

Train Schedule Example:
For the train schedule from Naperville to Union Station

Train Schedule around a time:
For the train schedule from Naperville to Union Station around 9 am

or

For the train schedule from Naperville to Union Station leaving around 9 am

For the train schedule from Naperville to Union Station arriving around 9 am


Express Train Example:
For the next train from Downtown to Northbrook express only

Express Train around a time Example:
For the next train from Downtown to Northbrook express only arriving around 6 pm

Express Train Schedule Example:
For the train schedule from Downtown to Arlington Heights express only

New in this Version:
* added 'around time'.   Now you can add the phrase, 'leaving around 5 pm' or 'arriving around 5 pm' to get either express trains or schedules around the specified time.  The skill is designed to look for schedules a little before the specified time and a little after the specified time.

Previous Versions:
* added express train.  Add the phrase 'express only' when asking for the next train.  This will provide the next train that is in the top fastest 20% of the remaining days schedule.
* added express schedule.  Add the phrase 'express only' when asking for the train schedule.  This will provide the all of the trains that are in the top fastest 20% of the remaining days schedule.

* the issue described by the 1 star review has been addressed.

Chicago
Downtown
Chicago Union Station
Union Station
Union
Chicago OTC

The skill will figure out which one is right.
