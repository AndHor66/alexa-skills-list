To use the Chicago Trains skill, try saying...

* *Alexa ask Chicago Trains when is the next train from Crystal Lake to Downtown*

* *Alexa ask Chicago Trains for the next train from Chicago to Naperville express only*

* *Alexa ask Chicago Trains for the train schedule for Joliet to New Lenox*

Never miss your train again.

Chicago Trains lets you find the next train leaving a particular station that stops at your desired destination.  It will also let you hear the train schedule for the rest of the day for a particular starting station and destination station.    For example, 

Next Train:
Alexa, ask Chicago Trains when is the next train from Crystal Lake to Downtown

Train Schedule:
Alex, ask Chicago Trains for the train schedule from Naperville to Union Station

Express Train:
Alexa, ask Chicago Trains for the next train from Downtown to Northbrook express only

New Version:
* added express train.  Add the phrase 'express only' when asking for the next train.  This will provide the next train that is in the fastest 20% of the remaining days schedule.
* the issue described by the 1 star review has been addressed.
** The Chicago stations can be referenced as:
Chicago
Downtown
Chicago Union Station
Union Station
Union
Chicago OTC
Olgilvie
The skill will figure out which one is right.
