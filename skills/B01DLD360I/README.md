FAQ:
Why can't this skill find my station?
* Metra publishes their data in GTFS format, and the station names are published for visual consumption, which is not how you might normally speak the station name.  For example, in the ME route the station name '55th - 56th - 57th St.' is how the name is published.  But you cannot say, '55th space dash space 56th space dash  etc'.  So I have tried to add aliases for these kinds of stations.  If your station is not recognized, send me an email with the route, station name, and what you know the station as and I will add an alias for that station for you.
 

The issues concerning the app not working was caused by an interruption with retrieving the train schedule data.  This issue has been corrected and train schedule data is now available.

This skill uses the static schedule published by Chicago Metra therefore unforeseen schedule changes will not be available.

Here are some example phrases:

Next Train Example:
When is the next train from Crystal Lake to Downtown

For the next train from Naperville to Chicago

When is the next train from Northbrook to Chicago

When the next train from Northbrook gets to Chicago

Leaving around a time Example:
When is the next train from Northbrook to Chicago leaving around four thirty

Arriving around a time Example: 
When is the next train from Crystal Lake to downtown arriving around eight

When you specifying a time, this skill attempts to use the AM version of the time, but if that is in the past it will use the PM version of the time.
