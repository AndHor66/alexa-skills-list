To use the Ooma Calling skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, use Ooma to call 650-555-1234*

* *Alexa, use Ooma to call Mom*

* *Alexa, ask Ooma to play my voicemail*

The Ooma skill lets you easily dial your phone using voice commands.  Say something like "Alexa, use Ooma to call 650-555-1234", and we will ring your phone.  When you answer, we will ring the other phone and connect the call.  You can also save nicknames so next time you can just say "Alexa, use Ooma to call Mom". The person you call will see the call coming from your phone number.  It's free to any US number.  NOTE:  This does not make your Echo into a speakerphone.  It is not possible for a third party to use the Echo microphone and speaker for a call.  This skill dials the number but uses your existing phone to connect the call.  

If you are an Ooma customer, please be sure to tap the "Login with existing account" link when enabling the skill.  When you login with your Ooma password, you will have the ability to check your Ooma voicemail.  Just say "Alexa, use Ooma to check voicemail."  You can also dial by contact name.  Ooma customers can manage their contacts at myooma.com.
