  "description": "I've always had fun with Madlibs.  A player is asked to fill in a list of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and other parts of speech.  When finished these are transferred to a story to fill in blank spaces corresponding to the list of words.  The story is then read aloud and the laughter begins as the story is twisted by the player's responses.  In this rendition, you don't have to enter any words, they're are chosen from lists of random entries for each type of speech.  Just ask for a story.  Every story will be different.",
