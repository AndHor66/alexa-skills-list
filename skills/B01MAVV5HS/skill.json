  "description": "The Major System is a technique for easily remembering numbers. The way it works is that each digit from 0 to 9 is assigned a consonant sound and then you add vowel sounds to form words, so remembering the number is as easy as remembering the word.\n\nFor example, the sound \"T\" is assigned to 1, and \"N\" is assigned to 2, so you can add the vowel \"I\" and remember the number 12 with the word TIN.\n\nIf you're getting started with the Major System, you can ask what the sounds are for different digits, for example:\n\nWhat is the sound for two?\nWhat is the sound for six?\n\nOnce you know the sounds, you can ask how to remember any number:\n\nHow do I remember two five three?\nHow do I remember seven two?",
