  "description": "Luma creates an outrageously-fast, ultra-secure Surround WiFi network thatâ€™s customized for your home. Luma allows you to pause all devices assigned to a specific user on your network.  If a device is unassigned (i.e. your smart thermostat or security cameras) the pause feature has no impact on those devices. Luma also lets you prioritize a device, giving it the fastest connection to the internet. In order to take advantage of these great features, you must have one device from the Amazon Echo family of devices and a Luma Surround WiFi system.\n\nHow to use Alexa to control your Luma Surround WiFi:\n\n* Open your Alexa app.\n* Enable Luma WiFi skill\n* Account linking required\n* You can: Pause and unpause your network's WiFi on demand.   Pause and unpause a default user and their default devices (configured in the Luma app settings).  Prioritize and remove priority of default device (configured in the Luma app settings).",
