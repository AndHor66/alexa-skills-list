Just start by saying \"Alexa, start sit ups\" It will guide you through the process and even tell you what level/day you should start on. After that you can say \"Alexa, start sit ups on day XX\". Dont worry if it gets to hard just keep repeating a day or couple days till you can complete the whole program. At the end of 3 weeks you can do 100 pushups!",
