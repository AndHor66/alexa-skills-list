  "description": "Chess960, or Fischer random chess is a variation on the game of chess where the pieces in the front rank are placed in a random sequence.  Many players enjoy this game because it allows the creative phase of the game to begin immediately and reduces the importance of memorization of openings.  \n\nThe random chess skill makes this game much easier to start playing: Just ask Alexa for a random chess game, and she will read you a sequence.  No need for dice, cards, or calculations.\n\nWhen you open the random chess skill , it will give you the sequence for the pieces in the white player's home row.  The black player's row is set up symmetrically to the white player's pieces.\n\nIf you need to hear the sequence again you can say \"Repeat\", and the skill will reiterate it for you., You may also ask it to create an additional new game.",
