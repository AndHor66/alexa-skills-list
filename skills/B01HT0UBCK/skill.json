  "description": "Stitch Counter allows you to keep your hands on your knitting and keep track of where you are in your pattern. You can track multiple projects.\n\nTo start, tell Stitch Counter to add a project. (\"Alexa, tell Stitch Counter to add project hat.\") Then just tell stitch counter how many to add. (\"Alexa, tell Stitch Counter to increase one row.\") If you make a mistake by adding the wrong number, or to the wrong project, you can also remove or subtract the same way you add.\n\nYou can switch projects (\"Alexa, tell Stitch Counter to switch to project scarf\"), and you can always get the status of all your projects (\"Alexa, tell Stitch Counter what is my count?\").",
