If you need to change the date, just say, \"ask Wedding Countdown to change my wedding date to...\" and the updated date will be saved. To stop or cancel at any time using the skill, just answer \"stop\" or \"cancel\" to any questions. For help, say the default command for available options or \"ask Wedding Countdown for help\".",
