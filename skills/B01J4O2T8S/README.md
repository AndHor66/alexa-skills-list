LDS Report used to be a popular BYU and LDS blog.  Although the blog has since been discontinued the staff has decided to try LDS Report on Alexa (it seems to be less time commitment and it is pretty fun.   LDS Report Alexa is currently run by a panel of former BYU students who are in various degrees of LDS belief and practice.  

LDS Report Alexa is updated at least once a week.  

*Warning - LDS Report alexa is not for all Mormons.  Some might find it irreverent, lighthearted or flat out apostate.

We try to maintain a non-argumentative tone.
