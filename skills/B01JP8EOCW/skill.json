Find more information about connecting Smart Home devices at http://amzn.to/291lR7u\n\nWhen using the skill, you need to specify by name which thermostat/sensor to use. There are two ways to define this/these names:\n- Use the name(s) you set up already – these are shown and can be changed in the Lyric app, or\n- Create an Alexa group, like Bedroom or Downstairs, and add the thermostat and/or one or more sensors to the group. More information at http://amzn.to/2965dCE\n\nOnce you know the name or group of your thermostat, you can say the following: “Alexa, lower Bedroom by 3 degrees”, or “Alexa, set Downstairs temperature to 72”.\nThe full list of commands includes:\n- “Alexa, set [group or thermostat name] to X degrees”\n- “Alexa, raise [group or thermostat name] by X degrees”\n- “Alexa, lower [group or thermostat name] by X degrees”",
