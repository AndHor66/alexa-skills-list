  "description": "By meditating once each day you will find more peace and balance in your life. While some people experience meditation as a restful break from their hectic daily life, what mindfulness meditation really does is lower our human tendency to react habitually to everything and instead respond wisely. Also, mindfulness doesn't make you weak, instead it makes you strong. You won't be motivated by stress, instead you will be motivated by passion.\n\nI'm a guiding teacher at InsightLA (www.insightla.org) in Los Angeles and these guided meditations are some of what we use to help people around the world.\n\nI will be improving this app based on user's experience..so let me know what you think.",
