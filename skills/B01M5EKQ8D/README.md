To use the PaperBoy skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, Open PaperBoy*

* *Alexa, Tell PaperBoy to tell me Technology news*

* *Alexa, Ask PaperBoy to give me top news*

Have you ever felt like you only ever hear about front-page news, and wondered if there was more interesting news to read? 
PaperBoy uses Google News to get you a quick piece of a handful of news articles. However, this is different from the Flash Briefing you already use because PaperBoy lets you ask for news about a specific subject whenever you want.
If you feel like you only ever hear the everyday, front page news, and you want to hear the news you really care about, try PaperBoy!
