  "description": "Laugh box will enable you to play different types of laughter as well as get their definitions. You should end up laughing along with the laughter you hear. Laughing along will decrease your stress, increases pleasure, and really is the best medicine. The more you use this app, the better you will feel.\n\nAll you need to do to get started is to ask Alexa to \"Open Laugh Box.\" When it starts, it will play a random laugh for you. After any laugh ends, you can ask Alexa for a type of laugh or to define a laugh. Try \"play me a baby laugh\" or \"what is a sinister laugh.\" You can also use say \"more\" after any laugh to hear more of the same type of laugh.",
