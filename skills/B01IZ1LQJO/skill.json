  "description": "This skill is an ironic twist on the magic 8-ball game.  Instead of variations of Yes, no, or maybe, users will get a Neil deGrasse Tyson quote.  You can ask it questions as you would a magic 8-ball.\n\nThis skill is an homage to Dr. Tyson's work.  The quotes are a mixture of science, philosophy and humor that are pulled from books, interviews, twitter, and podcasts.  Below are some links for more information.\n\nFor more information about Neil deGrasse Tyson and/or Astrophysics:\nBooks on Amazon: http://amzn.to/2a8z3qx\nStarTalk: http://startalkradio.co/\nNeil deGrasse Tyson website: http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/",
