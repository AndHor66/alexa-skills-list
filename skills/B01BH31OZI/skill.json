  "description": "Is someone you know having a birthday?  Surprise them with this silly skill that sings (er, raps?) the Happy Birthday song.  Just tell your Echo the name of the lucky birthday girl or boy and Alexa does the rest.\n\nSong can vary between uses to delight kids with crazy, surprising fun variations, including one that glitches and scratches (\"Ha-ha-happy Birthday to Yo-yo-yooooou!\").\n\nThough it might not win any singing contest, it's infectiously clever fun.",
