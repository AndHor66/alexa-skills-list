  "description": "Finding important Mississippi government information on ms.gov just got a lot easier. With ms.gov’s \"Ask Mississippi\" skill, Alexa can find information located on ms.gov quickly. All you have to do is ask. \n\nAfter you enable the skill, try asking Alexa when your drivers license expires (requires a myMS account) or how to renew your hunting and fishing license. \n•\tTo interact best with Alexa, you’ll need to set up a myMS profile on ms.gov. \n•\tIf you don’t have a myMS profile, set one up at ms.gov/myms.\n\nOnce enabled, say \"Alexa, ask Mississippi...\"\n•\tTo give me the contact information to the Department of Revenue.     \n•\tWhen does my drivers license expire?  \n•\tTo give me a random fact.\n\nAnd if you want more Mississippi information from us, that's great! Because we're building new features even as you read this. \n\nCheck out www.ms.gov for more info.",
