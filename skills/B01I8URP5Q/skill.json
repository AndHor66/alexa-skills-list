  "description": "On March 3, 1969 the United States Navy established an elite school for the top one percent of its pilots. Its purpose was to teach the lost art of aerial combat and to insure that the handful of men who graduated were the best fighter pilots in the world. They succeeded. Today, the Navy calls it Fighter Weapons School. The flyers call it: TOP GUN.\n\nThe Air Boss skill is inspired by my brother-in-law, Commander Bert \"Fred\" Sanford.  As a combat naval aviator and mini-boss of an aircraft carrier, \"Fred\" developed these set of questions to test if you're ready to be launched off an aircraft carrier at 180 miles per hour.\n\nThis skill is dedicated to the United States Armed Forces in appreciation of their sacrifices and successes.  The Armed Forces is instrumental to the preservation of the freedom, security, and prosperity enjoyed by the people of the United States.  The strength of our Armed Forces is the selfless dedication and commitment of their families.  Families are the force behind the force.",
