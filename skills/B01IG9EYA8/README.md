* *Alexa, ask root square*

* *Alexa, open root square*

* *help*

Root Square is a simple fun game for kids. Kids can learn square of numbers from 1 to 25 and square root of the numbers all by using their dear friend “Alexa”. This can be a fun game for the kids’ birthday party, a special return gift for one who answers all the questions – the idea is by the end of the party everyone is a pro and all children will get that special return gift or before they sleep (ps: counting numbers helps you sleep faster :)) or quick review of their math skills ahead of their Math test. 
This fun Alexa powered app randomly asks for 5 square or square root of numbers. On right answer, you score a point. For wrong answer, Alexa kindly tells you the right answer so that you can score 5 out of 5 in the next round. 
Warning for parents: please learn these skills first by Googling nops that is old way of doing things… Echoing - “Alexa, start root square”  if you do not want be embarrassed.
