To use the Tube Status skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Tube Status about the Victoria line.*

* *Alexa, ask Tube Status if there are any delays.*

* *Alexa, ask Tube Status  how's the Central line?*

Before you travel, its good to know if your journey might be affected by delays on public transportation. With The Tube for Amazon Echo, you can ask for the latest status or all London Underground lines, or a particular line. You'll hear if there's good service, minor delays, severe delays or any line suspensions.
