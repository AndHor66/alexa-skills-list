Kasa is a simple way to manage your home from anywhere. You can link Kasa with Amazon Echo to control devices like smart plugs and smart lights with simple voice commands. Just say “turn on the Christmas tree lights” and watch your kids’ faces light up. 
Before you proceed, please make sure that you have a TP-LINK Cloud account and you have enabled Remote Control from the TP-LINK Kasa App for each device that you wish to control through Amazon Alexa.
