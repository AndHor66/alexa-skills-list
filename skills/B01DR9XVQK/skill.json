  "description": "Let's Add is a skill that quizzes you on addition problems.  You can specify how high you want the questions to go, up to twenty plus twenty. \n\nOnce you set how high you want to be quizzed on, Let's Add will ask you if you want the questions to be in order, or random. As you are learning addition you may want to start in order, then as you get better and need to be challenged, you can try random problems. \n\nYou can say \"repeat\" to hear a problem again if you didn't hear it the first time.  \n\nYou can start over any time by saying \"Start Over\", or just say the new addition problem maximum values you want to go to, such as \"five plus five\". \n\nAt any time you can say \"stop\" or \"cancel\" and you will be told the number of correct answers you gave, and the number of incorrect answers you gave, out of the total possible addition problems. \n\nSo have fun, and learn to add.\n\nSend suggestions, comments, pictures of Alexa teaching you addition, etc., to \n\nsupport@wobblemouth.com.  \n\nI'm looking for new ideas to make learning fun with Alexa.\n\nVersion 1.0.0",
