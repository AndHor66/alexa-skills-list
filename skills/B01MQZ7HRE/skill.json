  "description": "Pig is a two-player dice game.\n\nA player rolls the dice and adds the total on both dice to their score for this turn. The player can then \"Roll\" again, risking the loss of all their points from this turn, or \"Stop,\" keep all their points from this turn and let the other player roll.\n\nIf any player rolls a one on either dice, they lose all the points from the current turn and the other player rolls. If any player rolls double ones, they lose all their points and the other player rolls.\n\nThe first player to reach 100 points wins.\n\nSample Instructions:\nContinue your turn: \"Roll\", \"Roll Again\", \"Keep Going\"\nEnd your turn: \"Stop\", \"That's Enough\", \"Next Player\"\nCheck the score: \"What's The Score\", \"Score Report\"\nStop the game: \"Quit Playing\", \"Exit\"",
