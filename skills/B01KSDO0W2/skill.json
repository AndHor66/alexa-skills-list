  "description": "I ride Caltrain. If you do too, you know it often runs into issues. Their updates are terrible, but a sentiment analysis of @Caltrain mentions on Twitter quickly lets you know if there has been a breakdown, accident, or worse.\n\nEnable this skill (unaffiliated with Caltrain) to simply ask Alexa to rate the likelihood of something being really off with Caltrain. A higher score is worse. If it is over 25, you definitely need another transportation option!\n\nCheck out: https://caltraincrash.appspot.com for a text feed.",
