To use the Ask Grandmom skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Grandmom for candy.*

* *Alexa, ask Grandmom for a dog.*

* *Alexa, ask Grandmom for a hug.*

Ask Grandmom provides comic relief by responding with an answer of yes for most requests - just like a typical grandparent. This is most enjoyed when Ask Daddy is also installed. New requests get custom responses, so check back often to see how Grandmom can fulfill your request.
