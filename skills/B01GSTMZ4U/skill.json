  "description": "In mathematics, a combination is a way of selecting items from a collection, such that the order of selection does not matter. The formula for calculating combinations is C(n,r) = n! / ( r! (n - r)! ).\n\nCombinations Calculator will find the total number of possible combinations when choosing a given number of items from a certain sized collection.\n\nTo use Combinations Calculator, you provide the size of the collection and the number of items to select. \n\nFor example, you can say \"Alexa, ask Combinations Calculator to calculate 20 choose 3.\"\n\nAlexa will respond with the number possible ways to choose 3 unordered items from a collection of 20 items.",
