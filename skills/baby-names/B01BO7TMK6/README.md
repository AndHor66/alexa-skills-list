To use the Baby Names skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open Baby Names.*

* *How popular was Emma in 2014?*

* *What popular boys names started with A in 2013?*

Once you launch the skill, say a popular first name in the US.  This skill will return the popularity in a given year between 1880 and 2014.  You can ask about a specific year or ask about boy or girl names that start with a certain letter.

UPDATE 2/21/2016: Now if you launch the skill, it will stay open after you ask it a question.  Say STOP to close.  Thanks for the feedback!
