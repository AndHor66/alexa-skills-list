Welcome to the basic Hive skill for Alexa.  This skill will enable you to ask Alexa to control your connected Hive devices.

To get started, ensure that your Hive Hub and associated devices are connected and online.  You’ll then need to enable the Hive skill by tapping ‘Enable skill’ at the top of this screen.  Then, you’ll be asked to provide your Hive login details so that Alexa can control your devices for you. 

Here’s a handy list of commands you can use with Alexa and Hive to control your home:

Hive Active Heating™ (assuming the name of your thermostat device is "room")
Alexa, set room temperature to 26 degrees
Alexa, increase room temperature
Alexa, decrease room temperature by 3 degrees

Hive Active Light™
Alexa, turn on my light
Alexa, turn off my light

Hive Active Plug™
Alexa, turn my plug on
Alexa, turn my plug off


Requirements:
Hive user account, password, and Hive Hub.
One or more of the following Hive devices: Hive Active Heating™, Hive Active Light™, Hive Active Plug™
