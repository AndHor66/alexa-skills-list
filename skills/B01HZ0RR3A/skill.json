  "description": "Sometimes the news is too serious... with Funny News, you can get the same information via comical headlines.\n\nFor example, instead of hearing news about a robber caught by police, you may hear something like this:\n\n\"Rules of a successful robbery: 1) choose your victim carefully; 2) have an escape route planned; 3) don't shoot yourself in the groin; 4) see Rule 3\"\n\n\n*Disclaimer* - Funny News pulls headlines from Fark.com and may therefore contain some mildly inappropriate content not suitable for all ages.",
