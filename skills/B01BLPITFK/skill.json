  "description": "Almond brings it’s WiFi and SmartHome controls to Alexa with features such as Parental controls, Guest Networks, Scenes and Modes.\n\nHave kids? Almond offers enhanced Wi-Fi features for Alexa like Parental Controls. Blocking your kids’ enabled devices is as easy as saying “Alexa, tell Almond to disable kids Internet.” Sorry kids. You’re welcome mom and dad.\n\nHaving a party? Everyone’s going to ask you for Wi-Fi access. Not a problem. You can enable and disable the guest network with a simple voice command like “Alexa, tell Almond to enable guest network” and have the guest Wi-Fi username and password sent to you via email. You can share this with your guests as you like.\n\nScenes enable you to control multiple devices with just one tap of a button. For example a single scene can dim all the lights and set the temperature just right for that special dinner date. To activate a Scene named Dinner say, \"Alexa, tell Almond to activate Dinner Scene\" or say, \"Alexa, tell Almond to set Dinner Scene\". \n\nHome/Away Modes together with our rules enable you to create intuitive automation. For example, when you arrive home between 6:00-9:00 p.m. weekdays, Almond will disarm the alarm, turn on the porch light for five minutes, and then set the thermostat to 70 F. To set a Mode on Almond using Alexa, you can say, \"Alexa, tell Almond to be in Home Mode\", or simply say \"I am Home\" after starting the skill. \n\nPlease note the minimum requirements for using Alexa with Almond:\nYou have an Almond +/Almond 2015 router with the updated firmware.\nAlmond+: AP2-R085-L009-W016-ZW016-ZB005\nAlmond 2015: AL2-R091\n\nYour Almond App (iOS/Android) is updated to the latest version.\nAndroid v6.0\niOS v2.0\n\nAn Almond account that you can create using the Almond App.\n\nSETUP: Enable the skill on Alexa and use your Almond account credentials to login",
