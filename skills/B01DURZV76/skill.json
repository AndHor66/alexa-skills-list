If you're correct, it will move onto another problem. If not, you get to keep trying.\n\nSimply \"ask Times Tutor\" to get started with multiplication problems between one and twelve. If you'd like to practice a series of numbers, such as all of the multiples of seven--one through twelve--then \"ask Times Tutor to practice seven\".
