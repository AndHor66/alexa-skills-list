  "description": "Are you interested in learning how to play the piano? This skill will build up the skills for any novice looking to get started.\n\nLevel 1 - Basic Note Recognition\nSay \"Start Beginner Note Drill\" and you can then get your hands set, then practice hearing individual notes, and trying to find them on a keyboard.  This is the first step towards understanding music.\n\nLevel 2 - Learn your first Song\nOnce you understand the notes, start with a basic song. Say \"Teach Me Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\" and the skill will walk through each note required to play.\n\nLevel 3 - Play a Duet with Alexa\nOnce you have mastered the sections, see if you can play the entire song along with Alexa in a duet. Just say \"Duet for Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\" and see if you can keep up and play all of the notes.\n\nMusic Teacher can currently walk you through the following classics.\n- Twinkle Twinkle Little Star (easy difficulty level).\n- Happy Birthday (easy difficulty level).\n- Old MacDonald's Farm (easy difficulty level).\n- Joy to the World (easy difficulty level).\n- Ode to Joy (easy difficulty level).\n- Auld Lang Syne - New Year's Song (easy difficulty level).\n- Minuet in G (moderate difficulty level).\n- Star Spangled Banner (moderate difficulty level).\n- Jingle Bells (moderate difficulty level).\n- Go Tell it on the Mountain (moderate difficulty level).\n- Fur Elise (moderate difficulty level).\n\nGo ahead and try it now!",
