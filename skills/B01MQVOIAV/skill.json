  "description": "This skill is designed to help members of a home Bible study based in Hawthorne, CA memorize important Bible verses that have been selected from our discussions.\n\nAs our study continues, the list of Bible verses will grow and expand. (Currently, we have only studied through the first eight chapters of the Gospel of John.)\n\nFor initial publication, this skill will simply choose a random verse from our list and read it out loud. As the list of verses grows, we plan to add the ability to request verses by book, date, and sequence.\n\nFor more details about our group, you can visit our website here:\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/homegrouphawthorne/",
