To use the Dog Buddy skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, tell dog buddy that I fed the dogs*

* *Alexa, ask dog buddy when did I feed the dogs*

* *Alexa, tell dog buddy that I fed the dogs ten minutes ago*

This skill records the most recent time you or someone in your household fed your dogs.  You tell it when you feed your dogs, and someone else can then later ask when the dogs were last fed so they will know if the dogs still need to be fed.  This eliminates the risk of the dogs missing a meal or being overfed.
