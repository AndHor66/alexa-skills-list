  "description": "Baseball trivia game with 200+ MLB and baseball history questions.  \n\nMain topics include:\n* World Series \n* Regular Season Stats, Records, Awards\n* Pitching Stats, Records, Awards\n* Team & Organization\n* Random catch all\n\nThis is just a fun endeavor for me to provide something other people might enjoy while coding a bit. So that being said, let me know via comments if you notice anything wrong or have suggestions for additional trivia questions. I'm hoping to add another 100 questions in the next few months. \n\nEnjoy!",
