When you enable this skill for first time, you will be prompted to set your default stop and route information. You do this only during first time setup and don't have to input the stop or route ID each time you invoke green bus.
<br><br>
You can also set a second stop/route of your choice. To get arrival information for second stop, you have to specify "second stop".

To get started, just enable Green Bus, and never miss a bus or wait for one.
