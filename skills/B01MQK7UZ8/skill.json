  "description": "Air Traffic Control uses live radar data to give information about aircraft flying within a 20-kilometer radius of a location. Depending on the information available, you will get information about the aircraft's manufacturer, model, current altitude above the ground, and who is operating it.\n\nTip: If your location doesn't have any aircraft flying overhead, try asking about somewhere else with a busy airport, such as New York City.\n\nCredit:\nADSBexchange, http://www.ADSBexchange.com\nGoogle Maps Geocoding API, https://developers.google.com",
