  "description": "Holy Rosary allows you to pray the Rosary along with Alexa. Simply say the name of the mystery you would like Alexa to pray and say ‘Amen’ after each prayer to continue. Alexa will keep the prayer count so you can focus on praying. \n\nIn this first version you will need to say the name of the mystery you would like Alexa to pray (e.g. “Alexa ask Holy Rosary to pray the joyful mysteries). After Alexa says finishes the prayer, say 'Amen' to continue. \n\nAs a reminder:\n\n- Monday & Saturday – Joyful Mysteries\n- Tuesday & Friday – Sorrowful Mysteries\n- Wednesday & Sunday – Glorious Mysteries\n- Thursday – Luminous Mysteries\n\nThe rosary will begin on the short strand with one \"Our Father\", Three \"Hail Mary\", and one \"Glory Be\". It will then continue with the first mystery. \n\nPlease provide feedback and suggestions to luiscamacho@gmail.com. \n\nPlease rate this skill and give your thoughts on which of the following improvements should be built first:\n\n- Adding the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary\n- Automatically say the mystery of the day\n- Change the user’s response to half of the prayer, instead of 'Amen'\n- Other (Please specify)",
