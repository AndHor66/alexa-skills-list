To use the Gospel Library Reader skill, try saying...

* *Alexa ask Gospel Library to Read Mosiah 3 verse 16*

* *Next verse*

* *Alexa ask Gospel Library for Scripture Mastery*

This will read Bible and Book of Mormon scriptures using Alexa's built-in text to speech engine. This currently is a work in progress but you should be able to speak naturally asking for the book, chapter, and verse you would like Alexa to read to you.
