No problem! Did you turn your bedroom fan off? Let’s find out! No hub or complicated setup required – just a simple device that turns any home into a smart home.
 
With the mydlink home skill, Alexa can turn your appliances on and off, set schedules and even monitor your energy usage. Enjoy your personal barista by asking Alexa to start brewing your coffee when you wake up or make sure to turn the lights off when you leave – it’s easy!
 
To get your smart home started, you’ll need a mydlink Wi-Fi Smart Plug (DSP-W110 and DSP-W215, available from Amazon and most retailers) setup on your Wi-Fi network and connected to your free mydlink account.
