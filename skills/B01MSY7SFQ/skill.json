  "description": "Many skills give you only quotes, and some skills give you only verses. This skill can provide either a quote or a verse.\n\nJust say \"Alexa, open Quote Box\", then say \"Give me a quote\". Alexa would pick and speak a quote. \n\nIf you are interested in a Bible verse, say \"Alex, open Quote Box and tell me a verse\".\n\nAfter speaking the quote or verse, Alexa would say \"Ready\".\n\nIf you didn't hear Alexa clearly, you can say \"Repeat\".\n\nIf you want to find out who wrote it, you can ask \"who is the author\", or simply \"author\".\n\nIf you're on Fire TV, you can also see the author of the quote.\n\nOn Echo boxes, you can ask Alexa to repeat the quote or the verse, or ask for the author.",
