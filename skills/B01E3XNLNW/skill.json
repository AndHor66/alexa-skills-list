  "description": "If you play a musical instrument (or sing) it is important to keep in pitch. This skill will play a pitch perfect tone (to the concert A440 standard) for you to tune against your instrument. It can play from the first to the tenth octave. To hold a tone longer, ask it to \"repeat\". Or you can say another tone to play. If you want to cut it off, say \"Alexa stop\".",
