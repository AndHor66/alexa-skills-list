Play music, search your collection, create Play Doctor playlists, and more. \n\nTo use House Band, you'll need a copy of JRiver Media Center running on your home network (that same network that Alexa is connected to.)\nYou must have JRiver set up as a media server, and have it be accessible from outside your home network (Note: this might require you to enable port forwarding.)\n\nPLAY MUSIC  (Music commands work best when you start with the word \"play\")\n\"Play the album [album name]\"\n\"Play the song [song name]\"\n\"Play the song [song name] by [artist name]\"\n\"Play the album [album name] by [artist name]\"\n\"Play songs by [artist name]\"\n\"Play [anything]\" - queue up everything with that string.\n\n\nMany of the above commands will produce a list of matching results. For example, after asking\n\"Play the album Kind of Blue.\"\n\nAlexa might say:\n\"I found two matching items. Heres what you have. Miles Davis, Kind of Blue. Miles Davis, Kind of Blue (SACD). What should I play?\"\n\nYou can the select from the list:\n\"Play the SACD\"\nor,\n\"Play all\"\n\n\nPLAYLISTS:\n\"Play my/the [playlist name] playlist\"\n\"Play the/my playlist [playlist name]\"\n\"Add the [song name/album name/search string] to the playlist\n\"Create a [artist name or genre] playlist\" - creates a PlayDoctor playlist\n\n\nCONTROLS:\n\"Pause\" / \"Stop the music\"\n\"Resume\" - continues playback.\n\"Next song/next track/skip this/next/thumbs down”\n\"Previous\"/ \"Go back\"\n\"Change the / set the volume to [1-10]\"\n\"Volume up / down / louder / quieter”\n\n\nQUERIES:\n\"Whats playing?\"\n\"What do I have by [artist name]?\"\n\n\nZONES:\n\"What are my zones?\" / What zones do I have?\" - will give you a list of zones\n\"Change the zone to [zone name]\" - changes the current zone.
