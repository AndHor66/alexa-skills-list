Play music, search your collection, create Play Doctor playlists, and more. \n\nTo use House Band, you'll need a copy of JRiver Media Center running on your home network (that same network that Alexa is connected to.)\nYou must have JRiver set up as a media server, and accessible from the internet. (Note: this might require you to enable port forwarding.)\n\n\nBasics:\n\nTo launch the skill:\n\"Alexa, launch House Band.\"\n\nTo play an album:\n\"Alexa, ask House Band to play the album Blood on the Tracks.\"\n\"Alexa, play songs by Bob Dylan\"\n\nTo play a song:\n\"Alexa, ask House band to play the song Norweigian Wood\"\n\nTo find out what's currently playing:\n\"Alexa, ask House Band what's playing?\"\n\nTo search your music library:\n\"Alexa, ask House Band what do I have by Prince?\"\n\nTo play from a playlist:\n\n\"Alexa, play my desert island playlist.\"\n\"Alexa, play the playlist mellow jazz.\"\n\n\nAdvanced:\n\nThere are two kinds of searches in House Band: loose and strict. Understanding both sorts of search is essential to using House Band effectively.\n\nFor a loose search, launch the skill and say 'play....' followed by as many key words as you think will uniquely identify what you want to hear. House Band will play everything matching *all* the words you say.\n\nFor example, if you want to hear your Louis Armstrong album 'Satch Plays Fats: A Tribute To The Immortal Fats Waller,' then launching the skill and saying 'Play Louis Armstrong Tribute' will probably get the job done. Or, if you want two listen to both volumes of 'Leonard Cohen: Live in London,' saying, 'Play Live in London by Leonard Cohen' will queue up both.\n\n\"Alexa, launch House Band\", and then \"Play love\" will queue up every song, album, and artist with 'love' in the name!\n\nLoose searches are also helpful in getting at difficult to specify albums, like albums with foreign words or symbols/punctuation in their titles or artist names, since you can just leave out part of the name and still play the album.\n\nA strict search tries to match exactly what you say. You trigger a strict search by starting the search with the phrases 'artist', 'album', 'song', or 'songs by.'\n\nFor example, if you say 'play the *album* 'Tribute to Fats Waller' House Band will look for an album with *exactly* that title. (It wouldn't find the Louis Armstrong album in the example above.) Strict searches are great if you know exactly what you're looking for!\n\nStrict searches really shine by allowing you to narrow your search. For example, 'play songs by David Bowie', will give you a list of all albums you have by David Bowie. You can then select among them by keyword. For example, if the album \"Space Oddity 1995 24 bit Remaster\" is among those listed, you can just say, \"play the remaster\" to queue it up. (Note: to select from a list, you must say \"play....\" and the word or words that will identify the item on the list.)\n\nTo add songs or albums to the currently playing playlist, just say:\n\n\"Alexa, add the artist Talking Heads to the playlist\"\n\"Alexa, add the album Blood on the tracks to the playlist\"\n\nZone Control:\n\nJRiver allows you to play music to different 'zones.' House Band supports this, too.\n\n\"Change zone to living room\"  -- will change the zone.\n\"What are my zones?\" -- to list available zones.\n\"What is the current zone\" -- to check which zone is currently active.\n\nYou can say \"help\" after launching the skill to get more detailed help.\n\nFor more information, please go to:\nhttps://www.sarkonovich-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/house_band","enablement":null,"exampleInteractions":["\"Alexa, launch house band.\"","\"Alexa, ask house band to play the album Blood on the Tracks by Bob Dylan.\"","\"Alexa, ask house band what's playing?\""],"firstReleaseDate":1453246054.923,"homepageLinkText":null,"homepageLinkUrl":null,"id":"amzn1.echo-sdk-ams.app.746d3120-de6b-47ca-a132-746f5b57e609","imageAltText":"House Band icon","imageUrl":"https://github.com/dale3h/alexa-skills-list/raw/master/skills/B01ATZM6N4/skill_icon","inAppPurchasingSupported":false,"launchPhrase":"house band","name":"House Band","numberOfReviews":3,"pamsPartnerId":"DV29gZ7L4MKExRFWzF5wCGsqB","permissions":null,"privacyPolicyUrl":"http://sarkonovich-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/privacy","shortDescription":"House Band allows you to access your JRiver Media Center music server.
