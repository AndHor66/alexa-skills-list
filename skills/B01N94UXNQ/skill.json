  "description": "You can ask Alexa to call out a group of Twisted game motions for you.  An example of one returned statement is \"Right Hand Blue\".  You can request that the motions speed up or slow down in frequency to have Alexa's speech as fast or slow as you like.  Alexa will continue saying randomized motions (and a few joke moves every so often) until you ask her to stop.\nThis skill is not sponsored by or affiliated with Milton Bradley or Hasbro, it is purely for your enjoyment!",
