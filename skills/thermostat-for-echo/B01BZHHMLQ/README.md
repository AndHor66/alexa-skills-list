To use the Thermostat for Echo skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask thermostat to set the temperature to seventy one*

* *Alexa, ask thermostat to set the temperature from sixty eight to seventy four*

* *Alexa, ask thermostat what the temperature is inside?*

Allow Alexa to control your Nest Learning Thermostat! She can set a single temperature or change the high and low settings in Range mode. Alexa can also change modes between Heat, Cool and Heat-Cool mode. Alexa can give updates on the current Nest temperature, mode, or range settings as well as the current inside temperature.

1. Create a free and confidential account at https://www.ThermostatForEcho.com
2. Follow the registration prompt to link your Nest account.

Once linked, Alexa can respond to natural, one shot phrases like:

Or:
"Alexa, tell Thermostat to change to Heat Cool mode."
