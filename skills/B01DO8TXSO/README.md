To use the CurrencyGuy skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Currency Guy what is the rate of USD to CNY*

* *Alexa, ask Currency Guy to find me the rate of Australian Dollar to USD*

* *Alexa, ask Currency Guy to tell me the rate of Euro to Japanese Yen*

Currency Guy can get you the exchange rate between two specified currencies based on today's date.By saying" What is the rate of US Dollar to Chinese Yuan", there would be a voice response returned with something like "Based on 4/1/2016, 1 USD = 6.45 CNY" and meanwhile a card would be generated in Alexa app in case you want to see the returned result visually.
PS: Currently not all currencies are listed, more work to be done in the future, hope you like it!!!
