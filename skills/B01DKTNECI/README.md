Alexa just became an NBA superfan! You can ask her for the statistics of any active NBA player or team. You can get the averages throughout the season, statistics for a specific game, or the last X games.

This skill supports continuous stats and filters. You can just ask Alexa to "open I know NBA", and just state player name, team name or filter (e.g., last 5 games, offensive rebounds) to change your query each time.
