You can get the averages throughout the season, statistics for a specific game, or the last X games.\n\nThis skill supports continuous stats and filters. You can just ask Alexa to \"open I know NBA\", and just state player name, team name or filter (e.g., last 5 games, offensive rebounds) to change your query each time.",
