To use the The Rabbi skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask The Rabbi what time is Shabbos in New York?*

* *Alexa, ask The Rabbi what's the Hebrew (or Jewish) date today?*

* *Alexa, ask The Rabbi what's the Parsha this week?*

Gives you the start and end times for Shabbos by city, the Hebrew (Jewish) date for today, tomorrow, any day this week or next (ie:a week from today), and the Torah portion of this week.

Version 1.1.0 adds the Hebrew/Jewish date feature and all cities now function. 
More features to come, we'd appreciate your suggestions: torah4elli@gmail.com
