To use the The Rabbi skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask The Rabbi what time is Shabbos in New York?*

* *Alexa, ask The Rabbi what's the Hebrew date today?*

* *Alexa, ask The Rabbi what's the next holiday?*

Gives you the start and end times for Shabbos by city, the Hebrew (Jewish) date for today, tomorrow, any day this week or next (ie:a week from today), and the Torah portion of this week.
