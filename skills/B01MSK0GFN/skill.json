  "description": "Glad Leftovers helps you make the most of your grocery budget by easily keeping track of your family’s food in either the refrigerator, freezer, or pantry.\n \nWhenever you’re done with a meal, simply tell Alexa to talk to Glad Leftovers. She’ll ask you what you’re storing and where you’re keeping it. Then the next time you’re looking for a snack, lunch idea, or dinner inspiration, all you have to do is ask Alexa to remind you of what’s already there to be enjoyed.\n \nAlso useful ahead of supermarket trips, Glad Leftovers can help you avoid buying food that tends to go uneaten, as well as plan for ingredients to spruce up that meal from a couple of nights ago… You’ll never waste time rummaging through the kitchen again!",
