CloudStatus will also list services that have recently-resolved issues.\n\nWhen issues occur, please access the AWS status page directly for details: http://status.aws.amazon.com/\n\nNote: If AWS Lambda in us-east-1 is experiencing a disruption, the CloudStatus skill itself may not be responsive.\n\nFeedback: cloudstatus@stormyriver.com",
