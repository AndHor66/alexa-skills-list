To use the CloudStatus skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask CloudStatus about the Northern Virginia region*

* *What's up in us-west-2?*

* *Tell me about Mumbai*

The CloudStatus Alexa Skill provides an interface to AWS service status information.

Let CloudStatus know what region you want to check and Alexa will respond with a list of services that are experiencing trouble and what kind of issues they are having (e.g., performance issue, service disruption, informational message). CloudStatus will also list services that have recently-resolved issues.

When issues occur, please access the AWS status page directly for details: http://status.aws.amazon.com/

Note: If AWS Lambda in us-east-1 is experiencing an outage, the CloudStatus skill itself may not be responsive.

Let us know what additional cloud services you would like to be able to check with the CloudStatus skill (e.g., Google Cloud, GitHub, Twilio, ...)
