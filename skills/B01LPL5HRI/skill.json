  "description": "Benchmark and Hero series workouts are used to track the performance of the CrossFit athletes.\n\nThere's three main categories of these workouts: Girls, New Girls, and Hero WODs. The total number of these workouts is over one hundred.\n\nSince athletes do not perform these WODs as often, it is difficult to remember all of them.\n\nWith Benchmark WOD skill by WIKIWOD, you don't have to memorize these workouts anymore.\n\nSimply ask Alexa \"What is Grace?\", or \"What is Chelsea workout?\"  Alexa will tell you what this WOD consists of.\n\nMore about Benchmark and Hero series workouts on www.wikiwod.com",
