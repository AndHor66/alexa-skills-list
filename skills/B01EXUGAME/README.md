To use the This Day in History skill, try saying...

* *Alexa ask This Day In History*

* *Alexa Ask This Day In History about November seventeenth*

* *Alexa Ask This Day In History June second*

This Day in History searches Wikipedia for events that occurred in the past on this day in the year. It will return one birth, one death, and one significant event. For each, it will tell you the year it happened and a brief description. 

Each reply is a random selection of that day's historical events, so you may ask several times to get different events.
