  "description": "Calorie Steps is a health and fitness skill that provides you with calorie and step information for a specific food. You request a food and then Calorie Steps will tell you how many calories that food contains. And how many steps you need to take to burn off those calories.\n\nThe purpose of the skill is to enable a healthy lifestyle. With Calorie Steps, you find out how many steps you'll need to take to burn off the calories for a food you're about to eat. So if you are about to eat something that is really calorie intensive, it will prepare you for the big exercise required to burn that food off.\n\nThe skill is powered by the Nutrient Data Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Calorie information is provided by this data source. There are almost a thousand food items available in Calorie Steps and more will be added over time.",
