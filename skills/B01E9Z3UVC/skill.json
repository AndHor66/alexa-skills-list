No more trying to remember a company's ticker symbol or telling Alexa to \"stop\" during a lengthy response!\n\nOpening Bell retrieves stock data from Markit On Demand and is not guaranteed to have real-time stock price information and is therefore only recommended to be used as a general reference and not for making stock trading decisions.",
