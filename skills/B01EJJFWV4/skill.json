  "description": "With the tado° Skill and Alexa, you can now interact with your tado° thermostats by voice. To get started, select the ‘Enable Skill’ button in the Alexa App to link your tado° account and discover your thermostat(s). Find more information about connecting Smart Home devices at http://amzn.to/291lR7u.\n\nWhen using the skill, you need to specify by name which thermostat/sensor to use. There are two ways to define this/these name(s):\n\n* Use the name(s) you set up already – these are shown in the tado° app and can be changed, or\n\n * Create an Alexa group, such as Bedroom or Downstairs, and add the thermostat and/or one or more sensors to the group. More information is available at http://amzn.to/2965dCE.\n\nOnce you know the name or group of your thermostat, you can say the following: “Alexa, lower Bedroom by 3 degrees”, or “Alexa, set Downstairs temperature to 72”.\nIf you have any questions, please visit the tado° Support page at https://support.tado.com/",
