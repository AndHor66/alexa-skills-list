You just connected your tado° thermostat to Amazon’s Alexa.
Congratulations and welcome to a new era of interacting with your devices.

Here is a short checklist of what you can do with tado° and Alexa.

1. Getting Started
“Alexa, discover my devices.”
This allows Alexa to discover all your tado° zones.

2. Heating
2.1 Set the temperature
“Alexa, set [heating] to 22 degrees.”
Tado° will set your heating to 22° and keep this setting for the default duration of this zone. To address a different zone, just name it in the beginning.

2.2 Increment/Decrement the temperature
“Alexa, increment [heating] by 2 degrees.”
Through using increment/decrement tado° will calculate the new temperature based on your current setting. It will keep this setting for the default duration of this zone.

3. Air Conditioning
3.1 Set the temperature
“Alexa, set [air conditioning] to 22 degrees.”
Tado° will set your air conditioning to 22°, stay in the current mode and keep this setting for the default duration of this zone.

3.2 Increment/Decrement the temperature
“Alexa, increment [air conditioning] by 2 degrees.”
You can easily increment or decrement the temperature of your air conditioning. It will stay in the current mode and keep this setting for the default duration of this zone.

4. Note
[heating] and [air conditioning] are placeholders for your zone names. Please address your zone names, and check if there are any special characters. It is best if you use simple names which you can easily pronounce.
