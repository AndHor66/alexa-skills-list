Use your voice to jump to your favorite TV station or directly into a Roku channel. For example, say \"Alexa, tell Harmony to turn on the TV\" to power on your TV, AV receiver and cable box and set them all to the right inputs.\n\nTry saying\n  Alexa, tell Harmony to turn on the TV\n  Alexa, tell Harmony to turn on Netflix\n  Alexa, tell Harmony to turn on the Discovery Channel\n  Alexa, tell Harmony to turn up the volume\n  Alexa, tell Harmony to pause my movie\n  Alexa, tell Harmony to set a sleep timer for 15 minutes\n\nWe recommend adding our Harmony Smart Home skill so you may turn on your TV or switch to Favorite channels without having to say “ask Harmony”.
