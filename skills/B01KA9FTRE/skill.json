  "description": "ShakesPartner allows you to practice any part from any Shakespeare play even when nobody else is around.  ShakesPartner will ask you for the character and scene you want to read and it will read for all the other parts.  It will also tell you when you've gotten a line wrong.  If you forget your line simply say \"line\" and ShakesPartner will remind you what your line is.  If you want to skip your line simply say \"continue\" and ShakesPartner will move on.",
