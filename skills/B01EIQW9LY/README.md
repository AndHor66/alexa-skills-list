To use the Nest skill, try saying...

Amazon Alexa and the Nest Learning Thermostat work together to help you set the perfect temperature - without having to lift a finger. 

The Nest Thermostat learns what you like and helps you save energy. And now, you can simply ask Alexa to raise, lower, or set a target temperature. 

There’s no need to go to your thermostat or find your phone to be more comfortable - just talk to Alexa on your Amazon Echo, Fire TV, Echo Dot or Tap. 

After connecting Alexa to your Nest Thermostat in a few simple steps, just say commands like, “Alexa, set my dining room temperature to 68.”, “Alexa, raise the master bedroom by 4 degrees.”, or “Alexa, cool down the living room.”.
