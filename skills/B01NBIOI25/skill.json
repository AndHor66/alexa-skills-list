Your goal is to guess if the card she will deal you is higher than her card. If you think your card will be higher, you choose to \"stay\". If you think your card will be lower, you choose to \"fold\". \n\nTry to get a perfect score by guessing a full deck of card deals correctly!\n\nQuestions or comments?
