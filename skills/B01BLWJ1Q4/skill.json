  "description": "Now you can control your SkyBell HD video doorbell with Alexa and the Amazon Echo! You can enjoy more security by turning on or off the motion sensor, starting live video recordings, or taking snapshots at the front door.  You can also turn off the indoor chime in your house so a visitor doesnâ€™t wake up a napping baby or interrupt quiet time. To get started, register a SkyBell account, activate the skill and then link your account with the prompts.",
