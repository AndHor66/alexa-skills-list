  "description": "Control LIFX with Alexa. Your LIFX Lights now talk directly to the Amazon Echo through the Alexa Connected Home. After a few easy setup steps you can control your LIFX lights with simple statements like:\n\nAlexa, Turn the lights on\nAlexa, Turn the Kitchen light off\nAlexa, Switch lights to 50% brightness\nAlexa, lower brightness by 25%\nAlexa, dim Bedroom lights by 25%\n\nSkills that are “Optimized for Smart Home” allow you to control your smart devices without saying “Ask” or “tell”. For example, if you have named your smart light bulb “Kitchen Lights”, you can say “Alexa, turn on the kitchen lights”\n\nHOW TO GET CONNECTED\n\n1. Make sure your lights are connected to your LIFX Cloud account.\n\n2. Open the Alexa app and go to Link with LIFX under Smart Home > Device Links and login to your LIFX account.\n\n3. Say \"Alexa, discover devices\". Your lights will be displayed under Smart Home in the Alexa app and you can optionally group them for Alexa here (hint: Alexa groups are separate from your personal LIFX groups).\n\n4. Say “Alexa, turn my lights… On” or “...Off”. That's it!\n\n5. Optional: Enable the other LIFX Skill, under Skills in the Alexa app, to control LIFX colors and groups. Once activated, say “Alexa, ask 'Life-Ex': what I can do with my lights?” and Alexa will teach you how to control groups of LIFX lights and even set their individual colors.",
