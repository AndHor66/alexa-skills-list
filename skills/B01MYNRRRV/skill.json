  "description": "Christmas Facts is the perfect skill for unboxing your new Alexa device on Xmas day, or showing your good buddy (Alexa) off at this year’s holiday party!  Loaded with over 200 cool and often unknown Christmas Facts, this skill is both festive & educational. What do you have to lose?  Might as well activate the skill and boost Alexa’s Xmas knowledge by 150%! \n\nIf you enjoyed using the skill do me a favor… tell friends who also own an amazing Alexa device about my skills and be sure to leave it a good rating / feedback.  Enjoy your Echo, Dot, Tap, Fire Tablet, or Amazon TV (whatever it is that you are using Alexa on) and have a very happy and healthy Holiday Season / New Year!\n\n\nEnjoy the skill… \n\nDr. Blankenstein\n\nwww.drBlankenstein.com",
