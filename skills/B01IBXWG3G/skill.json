  "description": "The Braille challenge is designed to educate  those who are interested in Braille by asking questions to test the user's knowledge of the English Braille code. Braille is the primary literary media. That allows people who are blind and visually impaired to read and communicate with others. Braille replaces printed text with raised dots on paper so that blind users can feel what is written on the page.",
