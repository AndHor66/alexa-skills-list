  "description": "IQ tests can be a useful tool to assess your intellect and problem-solving skills. If you're curious as to your own, there are ways you can find out. Make sure you'll be comfortable whatever the result before you continue.\n\nMeasuring IQ allows one to predict success in a variety of activities and to measure a person's ability to perform socially and compete economically. It reveals a person's strengths and weaknesses and highlights talents people don't know they have, improving educational and skills development. This type of testing provides a standardized method of comparing children's abilities and performance, accurately predicts scholastic achievement and identifies gifted students. This allows parents, caregivers and teachers to tailor education to individual needs.",
