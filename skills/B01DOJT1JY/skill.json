  "description": "Scryb makes it easy for anyone to send a SMS text message hands-free from home, or when you don't have access to a smartphone.\n\nTo start using the Scryb skill, say:\n\"Alexa, open Scryb.\"  (pronounce it like the word ‘scribe’)\nAlexa will then ask you for the phone number of the text recipient.\n\nThen tell Alexa the 10 digit phone number - example: \"123-555-1212\"\n\nWe suggest that you say:\n\"Alexa, tell Scryb that I'm home.\" or, \"Alexa, tell Scryb that I am going to the gym now.\"\nWe have found by using \"that\" before the text message it can reduce errors.\n\nIf you are asking a question of the recipient, try:\n\"Alexa, ask Scryb when are you coming home?\"\nMinor note, sent questions will not end in a question mark.\n\nTo verify what the configured number is, you can say:\n\"Alexa, ask Scryb what the number is\"\n\nAlso, please remember that: \n- It is not possible to receive replies to the text messages through Alexa\n- Only one destination phone number is supported\n- Only 10 digit North America phone numbers can be used\n- All messages are sent from (613) 909-8893\n\nYou can reach us at m21lab@macadamian.com",
