Using FIND allows you to search for a recipe to TRY. FIND results in a list of up to four recipes, usually with similar or exact titles. So, when the list is read to you, there isn't anything to differentiate the recipes. The companion app will display the search results with a picture, immediately after the search is completed. The voice command to try a recipe is, Try recipe one, two, three or four. In the app, click the star icon on the recipe you want to try.\n\nTrying a recipe will create a new current Recipe page and an Ingredients and Instructions list.\n\nTo navigate and hear ingredients or instructions list items use the GET voice command. \n\nVOICE COMMANDS \nUpdated: 5/17/2016\n\n--------------------------------------\nOPEN\n- Alexa, open Chef Sheffey.\n\n--------------------------------------\nFIND\nFind a recipe with a one to five word search phrase.\n\n- Find cherry pies\n- Find orange chicken recipes\n- Find green bean casseroles\n- Find honey glazed ham recipes \n\nAvoid using words like \"a\", or \"an\", or \"the\".\n\n--------------------------------------\nREAD SEARCH\nGets search results list and reads title of first recipe.
