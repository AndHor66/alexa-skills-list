Yet when the original ELIZA first appeared in the 60's, some people actually mistook her for a human. The illusion of intelligence works best, however, if you limit your conversation to talking about yourself and your life.\n\nInstall this skill to let Alexa bring you back to the early days of artificial intelligence and pretend that she is actually talking to you.
