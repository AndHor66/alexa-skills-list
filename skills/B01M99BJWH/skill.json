  "description": "An unofficial skill to check the status of Microsoft's Azure cloud platform.\n\nFor a global overview of how Azure is operating, simply ask Alexa to \"open Azure Status\" and you will be informed of any regions that are experiencing issues.\n\nFor more detailed information, narrow your query to a specific region to hear which services are currently impacted or operating at less that full capacity. Ask Alexa to \"ask Azure Status about [the region you are interested in]\" and she will do the rest.\n\nFor accuracy in obtaining the status of your desired region, please refer to the Azure regions as named within your Azure Portal, or as listed on https://status.azure.com.\n\nThis skill is not sponsored or endorsed by Microsoft. Microsoft, and Azure are either registered trademarks or trademarks of Microsoft Corporation in the United States and/or other countries.",
