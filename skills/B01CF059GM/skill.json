With this skill, you will never wonder if it's worth coming to office hours again! You can easily find out how long the average wait time on the 15-122 office hours queue is. The average wait time is pulled from the online office hours queue (cmuq.mod.bz) in real time so the average wait time is never out-of-date.",
