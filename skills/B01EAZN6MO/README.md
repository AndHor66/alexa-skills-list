* *Alexa, ask hillary's campaign for health issues*

* *Alexa, ask hillary's campaign to tell me what she will do for racial justice*

* *Alexa, tell hillary's campaign to explain me what she will do for women's rights*

Alexa is the official voice to promote Hillary Clinton's campaign through Amazon Echo. Ask Alexa to tell you the issues Hillary will execute in case she becomes the next president of United States.

You can also ask her directly about issues just like health, climate change and energy, college, economy. etc.

This is not an official channel for Hilary Clinton's campaign and the developer team doesn't take a side for any particular politic team. You can find this issues in the official website: https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/.

Nevertheless, you have all this explanation available just by asking Alexa.
