To use the Bay Area Transit for Caltrain skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Bay Area Transit for the next 3 trains from San Francisco to Palo Alto.*

* *Alexa, ask Bay Area Transit for the next train from San Jose to Millbrae 20 minutes from now.*

* *Alexa, ask Bay Area Transit in 35 minutes from Menlo Park to San Francisco.*

Alexa knows when Caltrain is leaving next. Ask for multiple trains at once or for trains leaving some time in the future.

This skill gives you the next leaving Caltrain, the next few trains in case you don't know which one you will make or one or multiple trains in the future - we all have to get to the station first, don't we?
