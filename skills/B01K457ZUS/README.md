Ravensburg needs your help, an evil necromancer and his monsters have been coming from the dungeon and attacking the town.  Your task is to slay the evil necromancer and return to town.  You will do this by equipping your brave adventurer and traveling to the dungeon to locate the evil necromancer.  In this dungeon crawling experience you will create a character and purchase items from the town such as weapons, armor, potions and spells but beware because the dungeon contains many different types of monsters and traps.  You will need to be well equipped and level up your character and then locate the evil necromancer who is somewhere in the dungeon and slay him to save the town.<br>
<br>
This is a complete fantasy role-playing game in which Alexa will become the dungeon master.  You will create a character, purchase items in the town, travel to the dungeon, fight monsters, level up your character, find chests, get more gold to go back to town and purchase better items.  First you will create a character and assign values to your character's attributes of strength, dexterity, intelligence, constitution, perception, charisma and wisdom.  The adventure will involve rolling dice to determine the outcomes of various tasks (Alexa will roll the dice for you).  Your character's attributes will affect how well your character does during the adventure giving you bonus modifiers that add or subtract from your rolls.  You will start in town where you can purchase various weapons, armors, potions and spells to help you during your adventure.  You will encounter various types of monsters in the dungeon that you can attack and kill which will give your character experience points that will be used to level up your character.<br>
<br>
It will be a difficult task to find the evil necromancer and slay him and return to town successfully but if you do it you will go down in the dungeon adventure hall of fame.  Below are some helpful tips for your dungeon adventure.<br>
