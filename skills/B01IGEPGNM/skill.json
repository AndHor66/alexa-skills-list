  "description": "When you play a game of Football Squares, you need to randomly pick two lists of ten non-repeating single digit numbers for the headers of the game chart.  People normally do this by picking numbers from a hat.  This Alexa skill can save you from the hassle of doing that, because Alexa will randomly pick those numbers and read them back to you.\n\nGet started by saying, \"Alexa, ask Football Squares to give me some numbers\".\n\nAlthough this skill was designed for the purpose of playing football squares, it's possible that you'll find additional uses for it when you find that you need to pick random numbers for something.",
