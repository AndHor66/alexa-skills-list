To use the Lets Multiply skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open let's multiply*

* *Alexa, ask let's multiply to quiz me up to four times four*

* *Alexa, ask let's multiply for help*

Let's Multiply is a skill that quizzes you on your multiplication table.  You can specify how high you want the questions to go, up to twelve times twelve. 

Once you set how high you want to be quizzed on, Let's Multiply will ask you if you want the questions to be in order, or random. As you are learning your multiplication table you may want to start in order, then as you get better and need to be challenged, you can try random problems. 

You can say "repeat" to hear a problem again if you didn't hear it the first time.  

You can start over any time by saying "Start Over", or just say the new table high value you want to go to, such as "five times five". 

At any time you can say "stop" or "cancel" and you will be told the number of correct answers you gave, and the number of incorrect answers you gave, out of the total possible math problems. 

So have fun, and learn your multiplication table.
