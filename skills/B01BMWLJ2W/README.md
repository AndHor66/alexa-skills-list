To use the Hebcal skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Hebcal when is Passover?*

* *Alexa, ask Hebcal to convert November 13th.*

* *Alexa, ask Hebcal for this week's Torah portion.*

Hebcal will tell you the dates of Jewish holidays, convert dates to the Hebrew calendar, and can tell you about this week's Torah portion. We can help you count the days of the Omer (7 weeks between Pesach and Shavuot).

NEW! Ask Hebcal for Shabbat candle lighting times in the USA by City or ZIP code.

Here are some more examples of what you can say:

- "Alexa, ask Hebcal when Shabbat starts in Brooklyn."
