  "description": "Expense Tracker - acts as a diary to keep track of money your friends owe you. You can create a report, add friends and start recording the money your friends owe you. So, next time, your friend takes some dollars from you then immediately tell that to Alexa for the record. Later, you can ask Alexa to brief the tracker report.\nYou will love it if you are a kind of person who regrets not remembering how much each friend of yours owe you after few days.",
