To use the Technology Buzzword Generator skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Tech Buzz to tell me something smart*

* *Alexa, ask Tech Buzz what is a smart thing to say*

* *Alexa, ask Tech Buzz to say something smart*

This skill will generate a technology statement using a large collection of buzzwords.  You can ask it to repeat it's last statement, or have it generate a new one.  Just say, "Alexa ask Tech Buzz to tell me something smart" and it'll give you a very intelligent sounding response.  Then you can either say 'Yes' to generate another, 'Repeat' to hear it again, or 'No' to end the conversation.
