To use the DC Metro Tracker skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for the next orange line to Vienna from Metro Center*

* *Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for delays on the red line*

* *Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for the current travel time between Metro Center and the airport*

Get the most up to date Metro Rail information to stay on top of your DC commute! Optionally set a default home station to make retrieving Metro info even easier.

FEATURES:

* HOME STATION ~ Set a default home station simply by saying something like "Alexa, ask Metro Tracker to set Metro Center as my home station." 
Once you have set a home station, Metro Tracker will assume your departure station is your home station unless another departure station is specified.  
Change your home station at any time simply by re-using the "set home station" command. 

* LIST TRAINS ~ list all trains scheduled to arrive at a particular station. Try saying "Alexa, ask Metro Tracker to list all trains arriving at Farragut West"

* FILTER LINE ~ Tell Alexa which metro line you are interested in to only receive train times for that particular line. For example, try: "Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for the next red line from Gallery Place."

* FILTER DIRECTIONS ~ Specify a destination to only get trains traveling in the direction you need. Try saying "Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for the next train from Union Station to Dupont Circle."

* AVOID EARLY OFF-LOADING ~ Specifying a destination will return times only for trains going *at least* as far as you need. For example, asking for trains going from Union Station to Dupont Circle will *not* return times for trains only going as far as Farragut North.

* COMMUTE TIMES ~ Get an estimate of how long it is currently taking to travel between station A and station B. For example, try saying: "Alexa, ask Metro Tracker for a commute estimate between L'Enfant Plaza and Columbia Heights," or "Alexa, ask Metro Tracker how long it would take to get to Clarendon from Metro Center."

NOTES:
* If at any time the app responds with "there is a ghost train to a ghost station..." this means that there is a train scheduled to arrive, but the WMATA database has no information on what line it belongs to, or where it is going. These are the trains that show up as "--- --- TRAIN" on the train arrival boards of metro platforms. Ghost trains sometimes have arrival times associated with them, and sometimes not.
