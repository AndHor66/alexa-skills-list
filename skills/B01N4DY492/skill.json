  "description": "Transit Tracker helps you with latest bus and train arrival information.\n<br> Fast. Simple. With Presets for default STOP and ROUTES.\n<br>\nTransit Tracker currently serves in the following cities: Ottawa (OC Transpo), Singapore (LTA Transit Bus), Chicago (CTA Bus and CTA Train).\n<br>\nWhen you enable this skill for first time, you will be prompted to set your default stop and route information. You do this only during first time setup and don't have to input the stop or route details each time you invoke Transit Tracker\n<br>\nYou can also set a second stop/route of your choice. To get arrival information for second stop, you have to specify \"second stop\".\n<br>\nTo get started, just enable Transit Tracker, and never miss a bus or wait for one.\n<br><br>\nTransit Tracker needs your help. Let us know if you would like to suggest any new feature. <br> Give us a shout at TransitTracker@ImpliedKarma.com<br>",
