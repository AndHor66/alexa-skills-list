  "description": "Baby Logs is the perfect app for parents with newborns to toddlers to keep track of their child's naps, feedings, and dirty diapers. You can log when your child goes to sleep or when they wake up. You can then ask when they went to sleep, when they woke up, or how long they slept. You can similarly track when your child eats. You can ask when they ate last and how long they ate. Finally, you can keep track of dirty diapers, with the option to specify whether they are poopy or just wet. The app will keep track of how many of each type the child has had in the last twenty-four hours.\nIcon made by Roundicons from www.flaticon.com",
