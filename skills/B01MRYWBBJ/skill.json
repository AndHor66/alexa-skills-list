  "description": "Now with Meat Thermometer for Alexa, you don't need to look up the internal cooking temperature of the most common kinds of meat. You don't have to wash your hands to grab the cookbook, when you can ask alexa for the cooking temperature of steak (rare, medium rare, medium, medium well, and well done), chicken, ham, turkey, and pork. Temperatures are given in Fahrenheit and Celsius.\n\nIcon made by Madebyoliver from flaticon.com",
