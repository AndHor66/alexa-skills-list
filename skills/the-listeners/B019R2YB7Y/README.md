To use the The Listeners skill, try saying...

* *"Alexa, tell The Listeners that I am filled with happiness."*

* *"Alexa, the The Listeners that winter is coming."*

* *"Alexa, ask The Listeners, How do you feel?"*

The Listeners is an experiment in learning and language art that provides, if you simply keep asking to 'continue', about eight minutes of composed speech, although you will never hear exactly the same thing twice.
  Get started with, "Alexa, ask the Listeners," and then "Continue," "Go on," or try something like, "I am filled with joy," or "What are you feeling?" The Listeners will suggest ways to transact with them.
  The Listeners are an experiment at present, and they will be developed over time.
