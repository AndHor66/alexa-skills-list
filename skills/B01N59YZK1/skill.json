Make it a habit. \n\nEasily add new habits to Alexa and then log the habit each day. Alexa will keep track of the streak and let you know how many days in a row you've logged your habit.\n\nDue to the way Alexa works, only approved habits can be added. Contact the dev if Alexa can't add your habit.",
