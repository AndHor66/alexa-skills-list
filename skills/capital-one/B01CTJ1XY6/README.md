To use the Capital One skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, Open Capital One*

* *What's my account balance?*

* *Make a credit card payment.*

Have a Capital One credit card, checking, or savings account--or even better, all three? Then take this skill for a spin.

Once you've enabled it, say "Alexa ask Capital One..."

·        What’s my current credit card balance? 
·        How much available credit do I have?
·        How much money do I have in checking? 
·        When is my credit card bill due?
·        What are my recent transactions?
·        What's my overall account summary?

Heads-up, to get started, you'll sign in with your Capital One username and password (which we keep completely private) and create a personal key for extra security. 

And if you want more from us, that's great! Because we're building new features even as you read this. But in the meantime, check out www.CapitalOne.com/Alexa for more info.
