  "description": "Daily Cutiemals will send cute animal pictures to your email. You will be asked to register an email so I know where to send the animal pictures to. You will be guided through this step for setting up your email. Once you have set up your email you may use a wide variety of adjectives (instead of cute), and a wide variety of animals (instead of cat). You are also not required to use an adjective and just have it send you an animal picture.",
