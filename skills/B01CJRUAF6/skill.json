  "description": "Update: 3/27:\nThank you for the feedback! I added the ability to ask for the last time a stat was tracked (make sure to ask baby stats to set timezone otherwise it will not be able to tell you the exact time only how long ago it occurred),\nExamples:\nAlexa ask baby stats when was the last {stool, wet, feeding}\nAlexa ask baby stats for the last diaper\nAlexa ask baby stats what time was the last pee\n\nOur first baby boy is about to be born! No I don't mean this skill, I mean an actual baby! In our pre-natal classes we were told that doctors required you to track certain statistics for your baby for each day when it's an infant. We talked about putting a pen and paper by the changing station, but realized that it would be really easy if there was a Alexa skill that could do this. This skill is designed to do just what it says. Track stats for your baby, and be able to repeat them back to you. \n\nJust say:\nAlexa, ask baby stats to add stool\nAlexa, ask baby stats to add wet,\nAlexa, ask baby stats to add meal.\n\nWe've added as many words as we could think of to signify \"stool\" or \"wet\". Other examples are poop, pee etc... Try to see if you can find the extra easter egg ones :). Baby stats will count the stats against the current day. Once midnight rolls around everything will be tracked against the next day etc and onward.\n\nYou can also ask Alexa to remove or delete stool, wet or meal as well.\n\nExample:\nAlexa, ask baby stats to remove meal.\n\nAs you tally up the stats each day you can go back and ask Alexa to \"get\" those stats and repeat them back to you.\nAlexa, ask baby stats when was the last poop\nAlexa, ask baby stats when was the last pee\nAlexa, ask baby stats what time was the last feeding\nAlexa, ask baby stats to get stats for February 27\nAlexa, ask baby stats to get stats for last Monday.\nAlexa, ask baby stats to get stats for this week\n\nLastly, don't forget to say \"Alexa, ask baby stats to set timezone\" {pacific, eastern, or central} so that it counts the whole day. It currently defaults to pacific time, so otherwise it may switch over to a new day 3 hours late.\n\nHappy baby tracking!\n\nFull list of examples to say to baby stats:\nAlexa, ask baby stats to add stool\nAlexa ask baby stats to add poo\nAlexa, ask baby stats to add wet,\nAlexa ask baby stats to add pee\nAlexa, ask baby stats to add meal.\nAlexa, ask baby stats to remove stool.\nAlexa, ask baby stats to delete wet.\nAlexa ask baby stats to remove wet\nAlexa, ask baby stats to decrement meal.\nAlexa, ask baby stats when was the last poop\nAlexa, ask baby stats when was the last pee\nAlexa, ask baby stats what time was the last feeding\nAlexa, ask baby stats to get stats for February 27\nAlexa, ask baby stats to get stats for today\nAlexa, ask baby stats to get stats for this week\nAlexa ask baby stats when was the last {stool, wet, feeding,poop,pee etc..}\nAlexa ask baby stats for the last diaper",
