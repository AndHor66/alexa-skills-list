  "description": "Your Netatmo Personal Weather Station now works together with Amazon Alexa to help you collect data that matters: measured right at your doorstep, just using your voice.\n\nThe Weather Station's Indoor Module measures your indoor comfort by providing vital information, alerting you when you need to air out your home to bring down its pollution levels. The Weather Station's Outdoor Module gives you relevant real-time weather information. You can complete your Weather Station with the Rain Gauge and the Wind Gauge.\n\nNo need to check your phone when you’d like to know the temperature or if it has been raining yesterday, just ask Alexa.\nShe can retrieve all your Weather Station measurements for you:\n•\tTemperature inside and outside\n•\tHumidity inside and outside\n•\tSound level and CO2 level inside\n•\tPressure\n•\t(optional) wind direction, wind strength and rainfall\n\nTo get started, select the ‘Enable Skill’ button to link your Netatmo account to Alexa. \nYou can then start to enjoy mastering climate measurements with your voice.\nJust say commands like “Alexa, ask Netatmo what’s the temperature outside?” to know if it’s too chilly to walk the dog.\n\nIf you have several Weather Stations, e.g. named “Summer House” and “Office”, just say the name of the Weather Station you’re interested in, in your request to Alexa. For example, “Alexa, ask Netatmo if it rained yesterday at the Summer House?” or “Alexa, ask Netatmo what is the humidity level in the Office?”\n\nIf you have an additional indoor module set up, simply choose between the name of the Base Station or the Indoor Module in your request. For example, if your Base Module is named “Living Room” and the Additional Indoor Module is named “Baby’s room” you can say: “Alexa, ask Netatmo is it hot in the Baby’s Room?” and “Alexa, ask Netatmo if it’s noisy in the Living Room?”\n\nHaving issues with the skill? Simply ask Alexa for details and assistance “Alexa, ask Netatmo for Help” and she’ll walk you through how to use the skill.",
