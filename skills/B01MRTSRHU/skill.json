  "description": "This skill lets Alexa read a daily scheduled passage from the Doctrine and Covenants.\n\nWe start on January 1st every year and end on December 31st, so join in with us!\n\nUnfortunately Amazon has restricted the skill by removing the word \"and\", so when speaking with Alexa you'll have to say \"Doctrine Covenants\" instead of \"Doctrine and Covenants\". Sorry!\n\nAsk Alexa every day to hear that day's reading. If you miss a day, no problem! Just ask Alexa to read the missed reading by saying:\nAlexa, get the reading for yesterday from the Doctrine Covenants\n-or-\nAlexa, ask the Doctrine Covenants to get the reading from December 1st, 2016.\n\nOther ways to phrase your interaction:\n\n-- Listen to today's verses --\nAlexa, ask the Doctrine Covenants to read today's scriptures.\nAlexa, ask Doctrine Covenants to read.\nAlexa, read from the Doctrine Covenants.\nAlexa, ask the Doctrine Covenants for todayâ€™s reading.\n\n-- Read the scriptures for another date --\nAlexa, ask the Doctrine Covenants to read me the scriptures for tomorrow.\nAlexa, get the reading for yesterday from the Doctrine Covenants.\nAlexa, ask the Doctrine Covenants to read for December 29th.\n\nWe love hearing your feedback on how to make this better. Feel free to send me feedback directly at feedback@scriptureseveryday.com. \n\nBrought to you by ScripturesEveryDay.com",
