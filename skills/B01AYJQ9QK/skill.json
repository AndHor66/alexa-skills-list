If you would like a different car type, you can say things like \"Alexa, ask Uber to order an Uber Black.\" From low-cost to premium, every ride option feels like an upgrade to the everyday.\n\nYou can also change your default pickup location, ask for a ride status, or cancel your ride. Switch between your Amazon Household profiles to request a ride from different Uber accounts. \n\nSupported Uber Services: UberX, UberBlack, UberSUV, UberXL, UberSelect",
