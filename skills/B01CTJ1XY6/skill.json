Then take this skill for a spin.\n\nOnce you've enabled it, say \"Alexa ask Capital One...\"\n\n·        What’s my current credit card balance? \n·        How much available credit do I have?\n·        How much money do I have in checking? \n·        When is my credit card bill due?\n·        What are my recent transactions?\n·        What's my overall account summary?\n\nHeads-up, to get started, you'll sign in with your Capital One username and password (which we keep completely private) and create a personal key for extra security. \n\nAnd if you want more from us, that's great! Because we're building new features even as you read this. But in the meantime, check out www.CapitalOne.com/Alexa for more info.",
