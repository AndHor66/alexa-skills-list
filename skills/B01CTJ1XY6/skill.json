  "description": "Ask Capital One about your credit card, checking, savings, auto and home loan accounts. Then try out our new feature, \"How much did I spend?\" to get quick answers on how much and where you are spending. \n\nOnce you’ve enabled the skill, say “Alexa ask Capital One…”\n\nFor your credit card:\n· “How much did I spend at Target last month?” \n· “How much did I spend at Starbucks last weekend?”\n· “What’s my current credit card balance?”\n· “When is my credit card bill due?”\n· “To pay my credit card bill.”\n\nFor your bank accounts:\n· “What’s my checking account balance?”\n· “What are my recent transactions?”\n\nFor your auto loan:\n· “What’s my car loan principal balance?” \n· “What's my payoff quote?”\n· “When is my car loan due?”\n· “To pay my car loan bill.” \n\nFor your home loan:\n· “What's the principal balance on my mortgage?”\n· “When is my next mortgage payment due?”\n· “How much is my next mortgage payment?”\n\nTo get started, sign in with your Capital One username and password (which we keep completely private).  You can also create a personal key for extra security. \n \nWe're always learning and building new features, but we can't do that well without your feedback.  If you have comments, please share them with us at www.CapitalOne.com/Alexa.",
