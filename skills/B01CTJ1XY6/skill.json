  "description": "Have a Capital One credit card, checking, or savings account—or even better, all three? Then take this skill for a spin. If you have an auto or home loan with us, you can now ask about those, too.\n\nOnce you’ve enabled the skill, say “Alexa ask Capital One…”\n\nFor your credit card:\n· “What’s my current credit card balance?”\n· “When is my credit card bill due?”\n· “To pay my credit card bill.”\n\nFor your bank accounts:\n· “What’s my checking account balance?”\n· “What are my recent transactions?”\n\nFor your auto loan:\n· “What’s my car loan principal balance?” \n· “What's my payoff quote?”\n· “When is my car loan due?”\n\nFor your home loan:\n· “What's the principal balance on my mortgage?”\n· “When is my next mortgage payment due?”\n· “How much is my next mortgage payment?”\n\nHeads-up, to get started, you’ll sign in with your Capital One username and password (which we keep completely private) and create a personal key for extra security.\n\nAnd if you want more from us, that’s great! Because we’re building new features even as you read this. But in the meantime, check out www.CapitalOne.com/Alexa for more info.",
