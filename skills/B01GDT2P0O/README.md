Civics (History and Government) Questions for the Naturalization Test
________________________________________________________
from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services site
________________________________________________________

There are a total of 100 questions on the test  

The civics test is an oral test and the USCIS Officer will ask the applicant up to 10 of the 100 civics questions. An applicant must answer 6 out of 10 questions correctly to pass the civics portion of the naturalization test.

On the naturalization test, some answers may change because of elections or appointments. As you study for the test,
make sure that you know the most current answers to these questions.

Answer these questions with the name of the official
who is serving at the time of your eligibility interview with USCIS. 
The USCIS Officer will not accept an incorrect answer.

Although USCIS is aware that there may be additional correct answers to the 100 civics questions, applicants are
encouraged to respond to the civics questions.
