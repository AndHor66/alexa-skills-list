To use the Scriptures Every Day skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Scriptures Every Day to read today's scriptures*

* *Alexa, tell Scriptures Every Day to read the New Testament for October 3rd*

* *Alexa, tell Scriptures Every Day to read the Doctrine & Covenants*

This skill lets Alexa read a daily passage from the Old Testament, New Testament, Book of Mormon, Doctrine & Covenants, or Pearl of Great Price. 

By default, the schedule is set as if you had started the volume on January 1st and plan on completing it by December 31st. In the future this will integrate with ScripturesEveryDay.com, where you'll be able to sign in and sync your schedules across multiple devices, so you can receive some spiritual nourishment by reading or by audio, wherever you are.
