To use the Board Gamer skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, tell Board Gamer my username is boardgamer*

* *Alexa, ask Board Gamer to choose a game for six players*

* *Alexa, ask Board Gamer how many games I own*

Board Gamer will choose a random game from your board game collection on BoardGameGeek.com, as well as tell you how many games you own (according to your public BGG profile).

In order to use Board Gamer, you will need a BoardGameGeek.com account.

To get started, say "Alexa, start Board Gamer", or "Alexa, tell Board Gamer that my name is [username]".

In many cases, it may be easiest to spell out your username:
"Alexa, Tell Board Gamer that my name is u. s. e. r. n. a. m. e."

If your username contains a space, underscore, or dash, you can say "space", "underscore", or "dash" when telling Board Gamer your name. For example, if your username is "example-user_1", say:
"Alexa, tell Board Gamer that my name is example dash user underscore one"

Have Board Gamer say or spell the username it has saved for you by saying:
"Alexa, ask Board Gamer to say my username", or
"Alexa, ask Board Gamer to spell my username"

Once Board Gamer knows your username, you can ask Board Gamer to choose a game for you by saying:
"Alexa, ask Board Gamer what game should we play", or
"Alexa, ask Board Gamer to choose a game", or 
"Alexa, ask Board Gamer to choose a game for five players"

Ask Board Gamer to tell you the size of your BGG game collection by saying:
"Alexa, ask Board Gamer how many games do I own?"
