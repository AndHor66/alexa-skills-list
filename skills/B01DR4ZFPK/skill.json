  "description": "Vikings were innovators of technology.  Their impact on western culture is evident in locations like Normandy, Dublin, and discovery of North America before Christopher Columbus.  Illustrating current computer concepts with the story of the Vikings helps to make connections for playful retention of storification.  From Bluetooth to Thor's Day, explore the storytelling method of learning about computers.\n\nMake sure to enable this skill before trying to call it.  Alexa will match Loki as your word without this skill being enabled.  Once the skill is enabled you can say Loki or Floki to run it.\n\nContent of CIS150 course, Introduction to Computing, Grand Valley State University.",
