To use the Memory Master skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open Memory Master.*

* *Start the game.*

* *The sequence is red green blue.*

Memory Master is the quintessential Alexa game for challenging your powers of recollection. Alexa will say a sequence of colors and then you must repeat the sequence back in order. Every time you repeat the correct sequence another color will be added for you to remember. Complete as many rounds as you can on your quest to become the ultimate Memory Master!
