With the Plume skill, you can now track live air quality metrics in your city and stay one step ahead of harmful pollutants.\n\nPlume provides the overall air quality level (moderate, high, very high, etc.), along with further detail about individual pollutant levels (particulate matter, ozone and nitrogen dioxide) and our Plume Index.\n\nYou already plan your day to make the most of the sunshine - now you can make the most of clean air too!",
