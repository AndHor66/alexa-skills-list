  "description": "This skill does control my Coffee Machine. Go ahead and make me some nice cups of coffee. If you want to develop a project like this, read the following site for instructions: https://www.hackster.io/bastiaan-slee/coffee-machine-amazon-alexa-raspberry-pi-cbc613\nRequired hardware is a Raspberry Pi, and a Coffee Machine (I used a Philips Senseo)\n\nI use the Raspberry Pi to send voice communication to Alexa. But this can be replaced by anything connected to the Alexa Voice Service (Amazon Echo, Amazon Tap, Invoxia Triby, Pebble Core, Nucleus, EchoSim.io, etc).\nAlexa will (with the help of Lambda and IoT) send commands to the Raspberry Pi.\nThe Raspberry Pi will do the interaction with the Coffee Machine to read the status of the machine by listening to the LED selections and Sensors, and change the status of the machine by inserting Button presses.",
