To use the Beer Bot skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open Beer bot*

* *Find me a beer*

* *List microbreweries for Richmond*

Do you need an assistant to help you with what beers to try out?  The Beer Bot is a helper that performs research for you on what types of beers are available as well as what microbreweries serve it up.  With data from more than one thousand microbreweries from across the United States, the Beer Bot application can be your own personal assistant.

- Find me a beer - this provides a selector guide of more than 100 beers. The skill will drill down into beer categories and styles, providing details to wet your appetite!
- List for me the microbreweries in (location). There are more than 50 locations to choose from, covering more than 1000 microbreweries.
- More details on (brewery).  After finding a microbrewery, you can also ask for any of the beers that are currently known.
- List for me locations. This gives you a list of all the cities that we have collected microbrewery detail on.

Disclaimer: the skill may not be suitable for all ages.
