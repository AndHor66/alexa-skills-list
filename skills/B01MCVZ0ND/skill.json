There are always three types of questions waiting for you: one serious, one silly, and one seasonal.\n\nTo see the world-wide, real-time results of each poll, please visit...\n\nwww.rulethevote.com\n\nQuestions change multiple times per week -- as soon as voting ends on one question, a new question takes its place.\n\nStuffing the ballot box is legal with this skill, so go ahead and vote as often as you like.  Just be sure to place your votes before time runs out on any one question.\n\nAnother opinionated skill from www.thomptronics.com",
