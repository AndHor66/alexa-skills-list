  "description": "This is an Alexa skill to help my tabletop gaming friends decide what to play. This is based on my personal game collection, but you can apply the suggestions provided to your own collection.\n\nAlexa will ask 'yes' or 'no' questions to gather information and give you a suggested board game. If you do not like the suggestion, you are able to 'play again' to get a different suggestion. Mostly intended for groups that have many newcomers to board and tabletop games.\n\nGame titles used within the app are owned by their respective publishers.",
