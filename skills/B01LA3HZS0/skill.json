  "description": "Having trouble coming up with a joke? \nThe BarJoker will try to help you by telling you a ‘walks into a bar’ joke based on a word or phrase you provide.\n\nStart the skill by saying “Alexa, open bar joker”, then say a single word (e.g. ‘giraffe’, or ‘guy’), or say a whole phrase to start the joke (e.g. ‘a talking dog walks into a bar’). You can also go right into a request, e.g. “Alexa, tell bar joker baseball”, “Alexa, tell bar joker a man walks into a bar”, or “Alexa, ask bar joker about baseball”.  If you can’t think of something, the skill will give you a few suggestions. You can stop anytime by saying ‘exit’. \n\nThis skill may not be suitable for all ages.",
