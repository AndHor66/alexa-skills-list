  "description": "Get a pizza delivered to your door without even lifting a finger. With the Pizza Hut skill for Alexa, you can browse and order from a select menu as well as reorder a saved favorite or past order.\n\nAll you need is a Pizza Hut account with a delivery address and default payment method assigned. No Pizza Hut account? No problem. You can easily create one during the account linkage process without the need to exit the companion app.\n\nOnce your Pizza Hut account is linked, just say, “Alexa, open Pizza Hut” or “Alexa, ask Pizza Hut to order a pizza.”  From there, Alexa will walk you through the order process and your pizza will be on its way.",
