  "description": "C# Quiz is designed to help teach students, or anyone interested in C#, .Net, and Object Oriented Programming. The user is first asked how many questions he or she would like to answer. The questions are asked in a multiple-choice format, with each question having four answer choices, and one correct answer. The user answers by speaking the number of the correct answer: one, two, three, or four. The number of correct responses is tracked throughout the game, and an overall score is given at the end. Questions are chosen in a random order, and answer choices are shuffled each time a question is asked.",
