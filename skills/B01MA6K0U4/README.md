To use the Counter skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open counter tool*

Need to keep track of a number but you keep forgetting it? Let Alexa do that for you! Just tell Alexa to add or remove a specific value from the counter and ask her if you need to know, what the value currently is.
Very useful, for example, for card/board games that need you to remember a number.
