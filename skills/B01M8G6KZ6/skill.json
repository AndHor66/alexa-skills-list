You'll find yourself at home or at work, wondering when the next class is.  It's easy to visit the website and see the schedule, but it's even easier using PB Helper.  \n\nSimply enable the skill and say \"Alexa, ask PB Helper...\"\n\nTo find classes:\n\"When are today's classes?\"\n\"What are the class times for Saturday?\"\n\"What classes are there for October 30th?\"\n\nTo find the next class:\n\"When's the next class?\"\n\nAnd if you already have a class scheduled, you can find out who the instructor is:\n\"Who is instructing today at noon?\"\n\nNote:  Currently this skill is restricted to the Pure Barre location in San Antonio.\n\nThis skill is not sponsored or endorsed by Pure Barre, LLC",
