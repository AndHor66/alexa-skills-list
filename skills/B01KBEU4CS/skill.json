The food finder skill enables you to use Alexa to find a restaurant in your neighborhood that matches your food and pricing preferences. Food finder's recommendation engine only offers recommendations that have been favorably rated by people in your community and then ensures variety by offering different restaurant choices each time you request assistance.\n\nTo get started, simply say “Alexa, open food finder.” Alexa will connect you to food finder and begin a brief interaction that will lead to a restaurant recommendation. Bon appetite!",
