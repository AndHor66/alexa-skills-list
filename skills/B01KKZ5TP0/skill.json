  "description": "Play a single game of hangman. Alexa will think of a word and you will take turns trying to guess it. In each turn, you will guess a letter and Alexa will tell you whether the letter is in the word, and if so, in what position or positions in the word it appears. If the letter is not in the word you will lose a life. If you lose all your lives before you guess all he letters of the word it's game over. We will start with short nouns and verb and we will move to more complex words as you progress.\nTry to exercise your memory by playing paperless and develop a strategy to guess the all the letters in the minimum number of guesses.\nIf you are having trouble spelling some letters, feel free to use the NATO or Western Union phonetic alphabets (alpha, bravo, Charlie, delta, echo, Frank...)",
