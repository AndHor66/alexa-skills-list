It is a great party game and will leave your guests wondering how in the world Alexa figured it out. Think of any character in the world and say \"Alexa start Akinator\". Go on, be amazed!\n\nPlease note: Abra can guess ANY character, and some questions may not be suitable for all ages. Player discretion is advised.",
