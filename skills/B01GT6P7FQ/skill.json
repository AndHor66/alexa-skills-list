  "description": "The I Ching, or Book Of Changes, is an ancient Chinese divination tool in use for over 3,000 years.  Think of a problem you are trying to solve, and consult I Ching on Alexa to get a new perspective to apply to your situation.  Alexa will choose a hexagram and its associated reading based on the traditional probabilities of the yarrow stalk method for selecting your hexagram, and also provide a reading of the second hexagram when the first has changing lines. The hexagram readings are based on the Legge translation.",
