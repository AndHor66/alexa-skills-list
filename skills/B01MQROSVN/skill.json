  "description": "Revcontent's Alexa Skill was built to make it very convenient for our publishers and advertisers to get their current stats for today. Instead of constantly logging into Revcontent.com, you can now ask Alexa for your day's performance. \n\nIt is required that you have a Revcontent.com account to use the Alexa Skill. After downloading the skill you will be asked for your username and password to Revcontent.com. After your account is linked, you can then ask Alexa for RPM, Spend, & Revenue. \n\nIt's as easy as \"Alexa, Ask Revcontent for Today's RPM\"",
