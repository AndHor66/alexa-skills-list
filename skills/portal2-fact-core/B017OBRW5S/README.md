To use the Portal2 Fact Core skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open Fact Core.*

* *Alexa, tell Fact Core to give me a fact.*

* *Alexa, ask Fact Core what does it know.*

The Fact Core contains information, but it's up to you to decide if it's true or if we just have a few bad sectors on our drives.  Generally speaking, trusting the Fact Core is about like trusting nothing bad will happen when you pull your uncle's finger.
