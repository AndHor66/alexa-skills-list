  "description": "With the HomeSeer SmartHome Skill and Alexa, you can now interact with your HomeSeer lights, switches, dimmers, and thermostats by voice.\n\nTo get started, select the ‘Enable Skill’ button in the Alexa App to link your HomeSeer MyHS account and discover your device(s). Find more information about connecting Smart Home devices at http://amzn.to/291lR7u\nWhen using the skill, you need to specify by name which device or sensor to use. There are two ways to define this/these names:\n* Use the name(s) you set up already – these are shown in the HomeSeer app or web interface and can be changed, or\n* Create an Alexa group, like Bedroom or Downstairs, and add the device(s) or sensor(s) to the group. More information at http://amzn.to/2965dCE\n\nOnce you know the name or group of your device(s), you can say the following: \n* If you have switches or non-dimmable lights, you can turn them on/off, for example: “Alexa, turn on my Bedroom lights”.\n* If you have dimmable lights, you can change the brightness, for example: “Alexa, brighten Downstairs to 60 percent\", or \"Alexa, dim the Living Room lights\".\n* If you have thermostats, you can change the temperature, for example: “Alexa, lower Bedroom by 3 degrees”, or “Alexa, set Downstairs temperature to 72”.\n\nIf you have any questions, please visit the Amazon Echo page at http://homeseer.com/amazon-echo-integration.html",
