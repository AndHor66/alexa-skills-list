To use the Zoo Keeper skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Zookeeper, what does a zebra say?*

* *Alexa, tell Zookeeper to make a sound like a whale?*

* *Alexa, tell Zookeeper: penguin*

Ask Zookeeper to play the sound of an animal. If she knows it, she will. If not, she's learning all the time, so try again soon. Find out once and for all: what does the fox say?
