  "description": "Trying to keep score when you're playing baseball can be difficult, so why not use your Alexa and have it keep score for you?  \n\nRoxie is a skill that tracks all of the basic information around a one-on-one pickup game.  Here are different features.\n\nTo begin, say \"Start Game\" and a new game will be initialized.  By default, the games are three innings long, and each player gets ten swings.\n\nYou can customize the player names by saying \"Change Player One/Two name to <name>\".\n\nSay pitch ball and Roxie will track that a pitch was thrown.  Let Roxie know what happened next - either say \"Strike, Ball, or Base Hit\" and it will track the score.",
