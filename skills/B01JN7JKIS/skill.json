  "description": "Should I ride will ask you for your zipcode and tell you if today is a good day to ride to work or not, based on the local weather patterns, temperature, and dew point (which is actually a better measurement of \"mugginess\" than humidity). After the first time you tell Alexa your zipcode it will use that moving forward, so you can just say \"Alexa, launch Should I Ride\". I built this skill because the default weather skill doesn't tell you if it is going to be too humid to ride comfortably, and I'd find myself having to check wunderground for the dewpoint during the summertime. Currently, the skill only works for United States zip codes. The skill is open source and I welcome feedback or suggestions: https://github.com/hous/alexa-ride/issues",
