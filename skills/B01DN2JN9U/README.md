To use the MeatButler skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, ask Meat Butler to help me prepare steak?*

* *Alexa, ask Meat Butler how do I make lamb?*

* *Alexa, ask Meat Butler what temperature do I need for rare steak?*

Let your butler serve you by providing the precise temperature to achieve a meal catered to your taste. Let the meat butler know what type of meat you want, and what rarity you prefer and she will provide the final internal temperature to achieve the perfect entree.

This temperature is perfect for using when cooking sous-vide and any other method you use. Just tell the meat butler what you are making and let her guide you to deliciousness.
