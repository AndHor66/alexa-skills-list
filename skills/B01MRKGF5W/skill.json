  "description": "MovieBot converses with you about new and forthcoming movies. To get the conversation started, MovieBot asks you for a genre to explore and tells you about a popular title from IMDb. You can ask what the movie is about, who stars in it, who directed it, its duration, rating, and more. You can also learn more about actors and directors that come up in conversation: what other movies they have worked on, biographical data, and notable trivia. Once you’ve learned enough about one movie, MovieBot can tell you about similar titles or move to a different genre. Stay in the know about new movies and find out what’s good before your next trip to the theater. It’s a fun way to explore IMDb’s data!",
