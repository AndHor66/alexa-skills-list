  "description": "My Tarot will allow you to request a card and gives you a brief explanation of the divinatory meanings or interpretations for your card.  The included explanations are adapted from The Pictorial Key to the Tarot by Arthur Edward Waite (Available on Amazon.com).  The original commentaries have been abridged and, in some cases, wording has been updated to modern usage to assist with pronunciation and clarity.  \n\nNOTE: At this time, My Tarot can only draw one card at a time.  For a mini tarot spread, you will need to make a new request for each card.  The ability to draw several cards in one session without repeating a card is part of planned upgrades.",
