To use the stopwatch skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, open stopwatch and start*

* *Alexa, ask stopwatch for my status*

* *Alexa, ask stopwatch to stop*

This skill provides a stopwatch for timing arbitrary things.

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.
