Warning. this skill may not be suitable for all ages

If you know someone named Chris on Facebook that's running for president, this skill is for you. It includes a quiz of Chris' best Facebook out takes. See if you agree with his policies before you vote.

But, I think we all know that Chris should be president and this skill will help everyone figure that out.
