To use the Motivate Me - By SexyHackers.com skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, motivate me*

* *Alexa, tell motivate me to give me a quote*

* *Alexa, ask motivate me for an inspiring quote*

Just say 'Alexa, motivate me,' and she will randomly read a motivational quote from our database.  If Alexa can locate the actual audio snippet of the author of the quote on YouTube, she will even play the original sound bite for you instead of reading it.  

Designed for entrepreneurs, software developers, business professionals, or people who need a little inspiration to start their day.  So get motivated and make today the day your dreams come true!  

We have also designed a t-shirt, poster, and canvas for every inspirational quote you hear which you can purchase on our website http://sexyhackers.com to support the development of this skill.   You can view a preview of the t-shirt design or poster containing the quote she just read in the Alexa Companion App.  

DISCLAIMER :  SexyHackers.com does NOT contain any nudity and is work safe.  It's just a fun website which sells t-shirts, posters, and hats containing motivational quotes.   However, some of these famous quotes may not be suitable for all ages as they may contain adult language.  We feature quotes from business leaders like Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Steve Jobs, Aaron Levie,  Haward Schutz, Blake Mycoskie, Dennis Crowley, Mark Zuckerberg and much more! 

If there is a particular quote you would like us to add send us the information on Twitter @MoreThanRewards and we'll do our best to add it for you!

Pease give us a chance first to fix it.  Since we don't have a way to contact you if you write a bad review because Amazon keeps your contact info private so we can't ask you for more feedback.
