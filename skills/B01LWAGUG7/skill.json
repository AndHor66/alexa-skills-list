  "description": "With the Philips Hue skill and Alexa, you can now interact with your Philips Hue lights and scenes. To get started, select the \"Enable Skill\" button in the Alexa App to link your Philips Hue account and say, \"Alexa, discover devices\". Find more information about connecting Smart Home devices at http://amzn.to/291lR7u. See below for directions*.\n\nWhen linking the Smart Home skill using your Google account with an iOS device, on the first try this may not complete. Please repeat process and completion should be successful. If not, try using a browser to enable Philips Hue with Google+ first, or check the FAQ link below.\n\nThis skill specifically adds support for Philips Hue scenes and rooms. It is only compatible with Philips Hue Bridge V2 (Square shape) and NOT compatible with Philips Hue bridge V1 (circular shape) in order to ensure reliability for this new functionality and to provide the best customer experience. The functionality of on / off / dimming is compatible with both the Philips Hue V1 (Circular shape) and V2 (Square shape) bridges. If you are not using scenes with your Philips Hue bulbs or have a V1 bridge, you do not need to enable this skill. Simply ask Alexa to discover your devices and push the button on the bridge.\n\n*When using the skill, you need to specify by name which device to use. There are two ways to define name(s):\n- Use the name(s) you set up already â€“ these are shown in the Philips Hue app 'Room' tab and can be changed, or\n- Create an Alexa group, like Bedroom or Downstairs, and add the device(s) to the group. More information is available at http://amzn.to/2965dCE.\n\nOnce you know the name or group of your device(s)/scene(s), and you have told Alexa, \"Discover devices\" you are ready to voice control your Philips Hue experience.\n- You can turn devices on/off, for example: \"Alexa, turn on my Bedroom lights\" or \"Alexa, turn off the Kitchen lights\"\n- You can change the brightness, for example: \"Alexa, brighten Dining Room to 60 percent\", or \"Alexa, dim the Living Room lights\"\n\nDefault scenes will automatically be created for each room, e.g. Relax, Concentrate, Energize, Arctic Aurora, Dimmed and more.  To control scenes, simply tell Alexa to turn on a <scene name> in the <room name>.  For example, \"Alexa, turn on Relax in the Bedroom\"\n- Scene names can be found in the Philips Hue app 'Room' tab after you select a specific room.  Feel free to create new scenes that work just for you!\n- After creating or renaming a scene, simply say, \"Alexa, discover devices\"\n\nIn case you still have some questions, see the FAQ: http://www2.meethue.com/en-US/support/faq-categories/partners/amazon-alexa/",
