Unlike other historical quizzes, wrong answers here will be corrected, with some added explanation and history about the answer, adding an interesting note.   Ask Alexa to Ask, Open or Start Presidential Trivia, and answer five multiple choice questions using numbers one through four.    Each time running this should present a set of different questions.   \n\nContact TorgCon@Aol.Com with any questions or issues.    Thank you.",
