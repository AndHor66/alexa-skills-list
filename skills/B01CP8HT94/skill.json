  "description": "Tracker's Election Odds is the premier way to get the inside scoop on who is likely to win the presidential nominations, and the presidency itself! Studies have found prediction markets to be better at predicting election outcomes than polls, so Tracker uses data from the political betting market Betfair.com to bring you the most accurate prediction possible for the outcome of the upcoming election. To learn more, including why prediction markets are more accurate than polls, see electionbettingodds.com/about.html\n\nAsk Tracker for a summary to hear an overview of the current predictions for who will win each party's primary.\n\nExamples of other things you can do are: ask Tracker who is leading in the Republican or Democratic primaries, ask Tracker who will be the next president, ask Tracker about the skill itself, or, if you miss a response, ask Tracker to repeat it.\n\nCredit to Maxim Lott and John Stossel's website electionbettingodds.com for inspiration, and for the data used.\n\nAt Majel Tech, we pride ourselves on our best-in-class language recognition. We've spent a lot of time at thinking up anything you might naturally say in requesting Tracker's functionality. Go ahead, try it! We think you'll be pleased.\n\nNote: that being said, we're not perfect! Sometimes Tracker might not give you exactly what you asked for. Please try again, and if it doesn't work, let us know! We want to continually improve our language recognition, and your feedback helps us do that! You can use the \"Send Feedback\" link at the bottom of this screen to do so. Thanks!",
