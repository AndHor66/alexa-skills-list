  "description": "The Motley Fool brings its easy-to-understand approach to Alexa. Once you enable the skill, simply request Alexa to \"Ask the Fool for Apple,\" for example, and you'll get the share price and today's performance (and check your mobile app to see more data like trading volume, P/E ratio, and price range). If there are stocks you follow regularly (and sorry, for now we just cover stocks), it's easy to create a watchlist by adding and removing companies. Then, once you've built your list, just say, \"Ask the Fool how my stocks are doing,\" and Alexa will report the overall movement of your watchlist and the day's biggest mover. It's a simple way to track your investments.\n\n\nIf you see something that's not working or you have a suggestion on the features we should build next, please let us know by emailing alexa@fool.com or call (888) 391-6123. We want to make sure this skill works for you! For more detailed information, head to www.fool.com/alexa",
