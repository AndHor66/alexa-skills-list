Alexa tells the player if the letter is in the word, then spells the word, saying \"blank\" for any letters that haven't been guessed yet.\nThe player begins by saying \"Alexa, play hangman game.\"  They can say \"repeat\" to hear the know letters again, \"new game\" to start over, \"tell me the word\" to hear the answer and quit, \"goodbye\" to quit, or \"help\" for more information.",
