  "description": "After successful integration with Alexa, user can talk to Echo locally to carry out some commands. To achieve this, user needs a Home8 account and has access to at least one set of Home8 system. Begin by linking Home8 account using the Alexa App.\nIf you have more than one system (also reference as location, or OPU/Shuttle) and more than one controllable devices such as garage door opener, switch, and door lock, you need to assign an “Echo Name” for each device on Home8 App (Home8 App – Side Menu- Amazon Echo). Name for a device of the same type has to be unique. For example, “Home” is assigned to Location1. Location2 cannot be assigned “Home” again. User needs to select an Echo Name for each supported device first before using the commands on Echo. The same name can be assigned to different types of devices. \nThere are 10 predefined names for users to choose from for each type of device. \n\nGetting started:\nUse the following commands to learn how to control home8. The commands will prompt Echo to ask user to say their command directly or say help for more information.
