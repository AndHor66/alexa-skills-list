To use the Translator for Alexa skill, try saying...

* *"Alexa, ask Translator to say  'it's raining' in Italian"*

* *"Alexa, ask Translator to say 'love' in French."*

* *"Alexa, ask Translator to say, 'the music was beautiful' in Spanish."*

Use Translator to translate English words and phrases into over 50 languages. Alexa will tell you the translation of words and short phrases in languages she can speak and send a card to the Alexa app with the translation and the phonetic transcription.  (Translations of longer phrases, or into languages that she can't speak, will only appear on a card in the Alexa App.)

To launch the app, just say:  "Alexa, open Translator." From there you can ask, for example, "How do you say 'Good Night' in German?"

To get a translation in one step, say:  "Alexa, ask Translator to say 'Hello' in German."

Important note: The launch word for the skill is "Translator", not "Translate."

After you launch the skill, you can say 'help' to get more information, including information about the languages Alexa Translator can work with.
