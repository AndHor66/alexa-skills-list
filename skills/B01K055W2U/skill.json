  "description": "Need to send a daily “I’m Ok” message to family or a shout out for help? Marvee for Alexa lets you send out notifications and engagement messages.  Free service includes: 1) Send your contacts an “I’m OK\" notification with Morning Beacon.  2) Use \"Check on Me\" to notify family or friends you need some one to look in on you when there is a higher priority need (non-emergency).\n\nMarvee gives those hindered by physical limitations (vision, mobility or just typical aging challenges) an easy way to communicate with family and caregivers. Other optional services include Call Me and Family News - let a loved one know to give you a call, or stay up to date with the latest family buzz. \n\nTo get started, enable the skill and link a Marvee account. \nThen just ask\n\n-  “Alexa, tell Marvee I’m OK” \n-  “Alexa, tell Marvee to check on me”\n-  “Alexa, ask Marvee to have Bob call me”\n-  “Alexa, ask Marvee for Family News”\n\nMarvee for Alexa uses the contacts you’ve specified in your Marvee app. Be sure to go into the Marvee portal, set up contacts and select how notifications go out to your loved ones (text, email or both). \nNew to Marvee?
