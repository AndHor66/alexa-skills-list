To use the Silly Things skill, try saying...

* *Alexa, Ask SillyThings to tell me to do something silly*

* *Alexa, Ask SillyThings to tell me a funny thing to do*

* *Alexa, Ask SillyThings to give me something*

Ask SillyThings to give you something to do and it will give you something funny to act out. 

For example, "Act like a fish out of water",   "Act like you just ate a really sour lemon", "Do your most silly dance", "Act like you are standing on hot lava", and many more. 

You can take turns asking SillyThings for something to do or, like our family prefers, randomly ask for something in order to bring some smiles to the room.

This Skill was developed by a husband, wife and their 7 and 9 year old sons who all like to find a reason to act silly every once in a while. 

This was a family project to get the kids exposed to programming and we have a goal to make a skill worthy of at least ten 5 star ratings.
